	When exposed to long-term humidity, Takata's ammonium-nitrate inflators can inflate with too much force and rupture, sending shrapnel into the cabin during an airbag deployment. The crisis has been linked to 11 U.S. deaths and triggered the largest recall in U.S. automotive history, with some 46 million inflators in 29 million cars in the U.S. alone as of early 2017. Regulators expect the Takata recall will balloon to some 64 to 69 million inflators in 42 million U.S. cars by 2020.

1,https://www.cars.com/articles/2016-another-record-year-for-recalls-1420694432785/,2016 Another Record Year for Recalls,"
CARS.COM ü How many recalls were there in 2016? The answer may surprise you, but that it's a record probably won't. The Department of Transportation said today that automakers initiated 927 separate recalls in 2016 affecting 53.2 million vehicles. That's an all-time high and the third year in a row that recalls reached a new high.

Related: Recall Basics: Everything You Need to Know

	If you've read past recall totals, 53.2 million may sound like a curiously small number. After all, the New York Times estimated in early 2015 that the industry recalled 62 million cars in 2014 ü a larger total than 2016. What gives? Simply put, counting recalls is subject to revisions. Recall notices issued is one number; recalled cars are another.

	Some cars are recalled multiple times for different problems or even the same problem; other recalls are phased in by geographic region or even particular groups within a given model year. The numbers fluctuate ü nowhere more apparent than with Takata's expanding airbag-inflator recalls. s. Early totals had Takata's recall affecting as many as 1 in 4 cars on U.S. roads. As of early 2017, the (growing) total stands at about 1 in 9.

The Problem: The front driveshaft bolts may loosen and allow the front driveshaft to disconnect, potentially causing a loss of motive power and increasing the risk of a crash. Dodge and Chrysler manufacturer Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said in a statement that it is unaware of any related injuries or accidents, and that an automaker review of warranty data led to an internal investigation that identified the problem.

The Fix: Dealers will replace all eight front driveshaft bolts for free.

What Owners Should Do: FCA will begin notifying owners on March 31. Owners can call the automaker at 800-853-1403, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's vehicle-safety hotline at 888-327-4236 or visit www.safercar.gov to check your vehicle identification number and learn more.

CARS.COM

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 19,000 model-year 2014-17 BMW i3 REx hybrid hatchbacks

The Problem: The fuel-tank vent line may rub against the ribbed wire protection sleeve of the battery-positive cable, creating a hole in the vent line and causing a fuel vapor leak. In the presence of an ignition source, this can increase the risk of a fire.

The Fix: Dealers will inspect the fuel vent line and replace it, as necessary, for free.

CARS.COM

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 200 model-year 2016-17 Chevrolet Suburban SUVs

The Problem: The vehicles were assembled with a convex right-hand side mirror instead of a non-convex (flat) mirror, which could cause the driver to misjudge the distance of other vehicles and increase the risk of a crash.

The Fix: Dealers will replace the convex mirror with a non-convex mirror and add a new page to the owner's manual with the customer notification letter, for free.

	Automakers will determine the specific cars affected by the recall expansion and notify owners. As we did previously, we'll reach out to automakers to make sense of it all, and we'll update this story as we receive more information. This story was last updated Feb. 3, 2017.

	On May 28, 2015, BMW added the 2002-2003 5 Series sedan (including the M5) and wagon plus the 2003-2004 X5 SUV, but only models with the optional sport steering wheel are affected.

	On Jan. 22, 2016, NHTSA said its latest expansion would include BMW, and the automaker responded Feb. 10 with a large batch of new recalls: the 2008-2013 1 Series coupe and convertible, 2006-2011 3 Series sedan, 2006-2012 3 Series wagon and 2007-2013 3 Series coupe and convertible, plus a lot of SUVs: the 2013-2015 X1, 2007-2010 X3, 2007-2013 X5 and 2008-2014 X6.

	On June 2, 2016, BMW added several model years for passenger-side airbags. They are the 2007-2011 BMW X5 xDrive30i, X5 xDrive35i, X5 xDrive48i, xDrive50i and X5M; 2009-2011 BMW X5 xDrive35d; 2008-2011 BMW X6 xDrive35i, X6 xDrive50i and X6M; and 2010-2011 BMW X6 ActiveHybrid. BMW is recalling the cars based on how humid it is where you live, but NHTSA plans to expand the recall to eventually become national. If you see your car listed above, it'll likely become recalled at some point regardless of location.

	BMW expanded the recall in January 2017 to include certain variants of the 2001 5 Series sedan (including the M5) and wagon plus the 2001-2002 X5. (Many of the expansion-covered models already are under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Mercedes spokeswoman Donna Boland told Cars.com that the recalled cars would include ""various"" C-Class, E-Class, SLK-Class and SLS-Class cars and GL-Class, M-Class and R-Class SUVs, all from the 2005-2014 model years. Daimler vans recalled include various Sprinter vans sold under the Dodge, Freightliner and Mercedes-Benz brands from the 2007-2014 model years.

	All the cars and trucks are being recalled for driver-side airbag inflators, Boland said. However, she did not provide a schedule for owner notification and offered no more specifics on particular model years or production date ranges for each vehicle under recall.

	Separately, the Takata airbag inflator recall already involves some heavy-duty Daimler trucks.

	On June 2, 2016, Daimler recalled various Sprinter vans for their passenger-side airbag: 2009 Dodge Sprinter, 2009-2011 Freightliner Sprinter and 2010-2011 Mercedes-Benz Sprinter. Mercedes-Benz also recalled the following cars because of defective passenger-side airbags. They are the 2008-2011 Mercedes-Benz C-Class; 2010-2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 coupe; 2010-2011 Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class; 2011 Mercedes-Benz E350 convertible; 2011 Mercedes-Benz E550 coupe and convertible; and 2011 Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG. The cars being recalled are based on how humid it is where you live, but NHTSA plans to expand the recall to eventually become national. If you see your car listed above, it'll likely become recalled at some point regardless of location. 

	Daimler expanded the recall in January 2017 to include model-year 2012 versions of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class sedan and coupe, E-Class coupe and convertible, GLK-Class, SLS AMG coupe and convertible, and Sprinter 2500 and 3500 commercial van (both under the Freightliner and Mercedes-Benz brands), all for passenger-side airbag inflators. (Many of the expansion-covered models already are under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Ferrari

	In January 2017, Ferrari added model-year 2012 versions of three cars: the California, 458 Italia (including the Spider convertible) and FF.

	On May 27, 2015, FCA expanded its Takata recalls to include a larger chunk of 2004-2011 Chrysler and Dodge vehicles than you may have seen here earlier. The expansion involves driver-side airbag inflators, and it supersedes a smaller recall in December 2014. (Note that many cars on the above list are also under recall for passenger-side airbag inflators; those campaigns ostensibly remain unchanged.) Also on May 27, FCA expanded its passenger-side Takata airbag inflator recall for the 2003 Ram 1500, 2500 and 3500; that partially supersedes an earlier passenger airbag inflator recall for various FCA vehicles.

	Importantly, FCA says anyone who got repairs under the 2014 driver-side recall will need to have them done again, but only some owners who got repairs under the Ram¨¹s passenger-side campaign may need new replacements.

	On July 10, 2015, FCA added 2008-2010 Dodge Challengers built from Sept. 19, 2007, to Oct. 29, 2010, to the list. The automaker found the Challenger was incorrectly excluded from an earlier nationwide recall for Takata inflators in the driver-side airbags.

	""There¨¹s no geographic boundaries but there are also no build date boundaries,"" Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker told us. ""This includes every one of those vehicles in those models regardless of where they're built in the world.""

	Ford made a host of additions on June 1, 2016, all for passenger-side airbags. They are the 2007-10 Ford Edge SUVs, 2006-11 Ford Fusion sedans, 2005-11 Ford Mustang sports cars, 2007-11 Ford Ranger pickup trucks, 2007-10 Lincoln MKX SUVs, 2006-11 Lincoln MKZ and Zephyr sedans, and 2006-11 Mercury Milan sedans. (Lincoln is Ford's luxury division, while Mercury is a former Ford brand.) The Mustang and Ranger already have been recalled for previous Takata inflators; the June 1 addition either adds passenger-side airbags or expands earlier Takata recalls. Ford will recall these cars in batches depending on how humid it is where you live, but NHTSA plans to expand the recall to eventually become national. If you see your car on this list, it will likely be recalled at some point regardless of location.

	Ford added more cars in January 2017, including the 2012 Fusion, 2012 Lincoln MKZ and many cars already listed above, all for passenger-side inflators. (Many of the expansion-covered models already are under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	The 9-2X, meanwhile, was expanded to a national recall on May 28. It applies to 2005 models built from Feb. 11, 2004, to March 17, 2005.

	On May 28, 2015, GM placed several heavy-duty trucks under national Takata recalls: the 2007-2008 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD built from Nov. 28, 2006, to Aug. 29, 2008, and the 2007-2008 GMC Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD built from Nov. 27, 2006, to Aug. 29, 2008.

	On Oct. 18, 2015, GM added a couple hundred 2015 Buick LaCrosse, Cadillac XTS and Chevrolet Malibu sedans, plus 2015 GMC Terrain and Chevrolet Equinox SUVs and Chevrolet Camaro sports cars. The latest recall stems from faulty Takata seat-mounted side airbag inflators, however. It's the first instance in this crisis of a recall over side airbags, not frontal ones.

	NHTSA's Jan. 22, 2016, recall expansion added the Saab 9-3 luxury car to the list for the 2003-2011 model years, and the Saab 9-5 to the list for the 2010-2011 model years. (GM owned Saab until 2010.) GM also issued a Takata airbag inflator recall for the Saturn Astra hatchback for the 2008-2009 model years.

	On May 27, 2016, regulators added the 2006 Saab 9-2X and 2009-2010 Pontiac Vibe for certain regions. NHTSA plans to expand those areas to eventually become national, however.

	On June 2, 2016, GM recalled the following pickup trucks and SUVs for passenger-side airbag inflators: 2007-2011 Cadillac Escalade, Escalade ESV and Escalade EXT; 2007-2011 Chevrolet Avalanche; 2007-2011 Chevrolet Silverado 1500; 2007-2011 Chevrolet Suburban; 2007-2011 Chevrolet Tahoe; 2007-2011 GMC Sierra 1500; 2007-2011 GMC Yukon and Yukon XL; 2009-2011 Chevrolet Silverado 2500 and 3500; and 2009-2011 GMC Sierra 2500 and 3500. The cars being recalled are based on how humid it is where you live, but NHTSA plans to expand the recall to eventually become national. If you see your car listed above, it'll likely become recalled at some point regardless of location. 

	Honda announced May 28, 2015, it would recall more 2001 and 2003-2005 Civics as well as 2003-2007 Accords for front-passenger airbag inflators, even as both cars were already under recall for driver-side airbag inflators. Honda's front-passenger airbag inflator recall has largely been limited to areas of high absolute humidity, like the Gulf Coast. The automaker has a national campaign for driver-side airbag inflators, which on May 28 it said it would upgrade from a voluntary ""Safety Improvement Campaign"" to a formal recall.

	Still, the automaker cautions that this is a simplified list, and not every car within these model years is under recall. But ""it's fair to say that most vehicles within each model and year would be affected by one or more of the recalls,"" spokesman Chris Martin said on June 8, 2015.

	Honda added more cars in January 2017, including the 2006-2012 Acura RL, 2012 Acura TSX sedan and 2012 TSX Sport Wagon, 2012 Honda Accord, 2012 Honda Crosstour, 2012 Honda Pilot and many more cars already listed above, all for passenger-side inflators. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Jaguar Land Rover

	In January 2017, Jaguar expanded the recall to add the 2012 Jaguar XF and 2012 Land Rover Range Rover. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Karma (Fisker)

	A smaller group of Mazda6s, RX-8s and MPVs are under a separate Takata recall in areas of high absolute humidity, so if you live around the Gulf Coast or certain U.S. islands and own a Mazda6 or RX-8, your car may have more than one recall. The regional campaign affects 2003-2006 Mazda6s built from Jan. 17, 2003, to Dec. 13, 2005; 2004-2005 RX-8s built from April 10, 2003, to Aug. 20, 2004; and 2004-2005 MPVs built from Aug. 20, 2003, to Aug. 27, 2004. Given the recall only affects ""certain"" cars, according to Mazda, not every car in those regions and build dates may get the recall.

	On Jan. 22, 2016, NHTSA expanded the recalls for the B-Series to add the driver-side airbag inflator. Mazda responded on Feb. 1 by recalling the 2004-06 B-Series pickup trucks to include driver-side airbag inflators; the original recall only applied to passenger-side airbag inflators.

	In January 2017, Mazda expanded the recall to include the 2007-2009 B-Series pickup, 2009 RX-8 coupe and model-year 2012 versions of the CX-7 and CX-9 SUVs as well as the Mazda6 sedan. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	McLaren

	On May 27, 2015, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles expanded the Raider recall to include the 2006-2011 model years. The Raider is closely related to the Dodge Dakota and was built in affiliation with then-DaimlerChrysler (now FCA). Dodge is an FCA brand.

	Previously, Mitsubishi ""had a regional campaign going"" on the Lancer, Fedorak said. ""It's going to go to a national campaign now.""

	On May 27, 2016, Mitsubishi and FCA added the 2007 Lancer, including Lancer Evolution models built until June 19, 2007.

	In January 2017, Mitsubishi expanded the recall to cover the 2012 and 2014 i-MiEV electric hatchbacks.

	Many cars under the national recall are also under regional campaigns, but 2004 Infiniti I's, 2006 M's and 2004-2005 FXs appear to still be under regional campaigns only.

	""There is significant overlap between national recalls and regional (high humidity) populations,"" Yaeger wrote in an email. The regional campaigns included ""just over 100,000 vehicles"" that weren't in the national campaign.

	In January 2017, Nissan expanded the recall to add the 2012 Versa hatchback. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Subaru spokesman Michael McHale told us the expansion doesn't affect Subaru's Takata campaigns on the 2003-2008 Legacys and Outbacks, and 2003-2005 Bajas. NHTSA expanded the pool on Dec. 23 to include the 2006-2008 Legacys and Outbacks. All recalls are national in scope.

	If you have an Impreza-based WRX or WRX STI for the Impreza's model years listed above, chances are it's also under recall. Subaru confirmed as much in a major January 2017 expansion that also added 2012 model-year versions of the Tribeca, Forester, Legacy, Outback and WRX (but not the 2012 Impreza). (Many of the expansion-covered models were already under previous recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	Tesla

	Toyota spokeswoman Cindy Knight said on June 17, 2015, that ""not every single vehicle of the model year"" listed will actually be recalled, but a Cars.com analysis in 2015 of Toyota's self-reported recall totals versus Automotive News sales data for the respective model years suggests that the vast majority of cars in the recalled years will, in fact, be recalled. Owners in regions with high absolute humidity may receive unique regional recall notices instead of national ones, but Knight said the repairs are the same.

	An additional expansion came in January 2017, when Toyota added the 2012 model-year versions of the Scion xB and Toyota 4Runner, Corolla, Matrix, Sienna and Yaris. The automaker also added model-year 2012 versions of the Lexus IS (including the IS convertible and IS-F high-performance sedan), ES 350, GX and LFA. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	On June 2, 2016, Volkswagen Group recalled the 2004-2008 Audi A4 and 2005-2011 Audi A6 for passenger-side Takata airbag inflators. The cars being recalled are based on how humid it is where you live, but NHTSA plans to expand the recall to eventually become national. If you see your car listed above, it'll likely become recalled at some point regardless of location. 

	An additional expansion came in January 2017, when the Volkswagen Group added the 2007-2009 Audi S4 convertible and S6 sedan, as well as the 2005-2008 S4 sedan and wagon, 2007-2008 RS 4 sedan and 2008 RS 4 convertible. (Many of the expansion-covered models are already under recall as automakers expand the scope or geographic region of recalls within a given model year, add different inflators or recall replacement inflators.)

	That said, the May 19, 2015 announcement suggests more cars in a given year should have recalls. That's because NHTSA is pushing for nationwide recalls instead of regional ones, and some cars, like the Mitsubishi Lancer, have expanded their recall status to entire model years instead of a range of manufacture dates.

	""It generally takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks for automakers to gather individual VINs associated with a recall,"" NHTSA's website said as of May 20, 2015. ""It is important that you check back periodically as a recall on your vehicle may not show up immediately.""

	Other owners won't need additional repairs. Mitsubishi's Fedorak said owners who have already received repairs are ""good ... [and] they don't have to be recalled again.""

	A ""lack of parts now and in the future"" for recalled Takata airbag inflators was the biggest driver for AutoNation's policy change, Marc Cannon, AutoNation spokesman, said via email. 

	AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson decided to reverse the decision when he concluded that lawmakers' efforts to ban the sale of used cars with unfixed recalls would falter under President-elect Donald Trump, Automotive News reported. Jackson reportedly told Automotive News that his dealers will repair cars with available parts whenever possible.

	Jackson said that in the event his dealers sell a car with an unfixed recall ¨¹ whether to a consumer or auction lot ¨¹ they'll disclose its status. In November, the group's dealers reportedly had some 6,000 used cars on hold because of its erstwhile policy, mostly because of Takata inflator recalls with still-missing parts.

	Today's action creates two sets of deadlines. One creates deadlines for automakers to obtain sufficient repair parts for the vehicles in the highest-risk group, with the aim to skew parts production toward the riskiest vehicles. The other creates a schedule from that point over the next 10 quarters for the maker to repair 100 percent of those cars. NHTSA noted in its press briefing that the average repair completion rate after two-and-a-half years is only about 30 percent. To help hit the higher rate, NHTSA will oversee expanded efforts to notify owners and prompt them to get repairs.

	The U.S. Takata recall currently covers only front airbag inflators with propellant that does not include a drying agent, called a desiccant, that absorbs moisture. There have been no reported failures of inflators with the drying agent. NHTSA has given Takata and automakers until the end of 2019 to provide research proving their safety, or they, too, would have to be recalled.

10,https://www.cars.com/articles/recall-basics-everything-you-need-to-know-1420692280985/,Recall Basics: Everything You Need to Know,"
	Here's a primer.

	How a Safety Recall Works

	How can I check to see if my car has any recalls?

	I think there's a problem with my car. How can I get it recalled?

	How many defect reports have to be submitted before NHTSA opens an investigation?

	There's no set number, the agency says. NHTSA compares the number of complaints for a given vehicle or piece of equipment against the total number manufactured. It also considers petitions that have been filed asking that an investigation be opened.

	How long does it take an investigation to become a recall?

	It depends. As NHTSA explains, the path from an investigation to a court-ordered recall is fairly involved:

	1. Regulators start with an evaluation, a solicitation for information from the manufacturer, and a chance for the manufacturer to present its side of things.

	2. If there's enough evidence of a safety defect, investigators conduct an engineering analysis. That means more information requests plus tests, surveys and inspections.

	3. Investigators then submit their conclusions to a review panel. If the panel agrees, regulators send a recall request to the manufacturer.

	4. If the manufacturer refuses to issue a recall, NHTSA can convene a public meeting where the manufacturer, any interested third parties and members of the public can debate the issue.

	5. If the meeting supports a defect finding, NHTSA's chief administrator can issue a final ruling that a defect exists and order the manufacturer to conduct a recall.

	6. The manufacturer can still challenge the ruling in federal court, but at this point, it may be obligated to notify consumers that investigators have ruled a safety defect exists.

	When a recall is issued, how do automakers track down owners?

	Automakers merge their own records of vehicle purchasers with vehicle-registration information to track down owners and let them know of the problem, fix it, replace the vehicle or repurchase it minus a ""reasonable allowance for depreciation,"" NHTSA says. For certain recalls, some dealers elect to offer loaner vehicles during repairs.

	What does a recall notice look like?

	What should I do if I get one of those letters?

	What if my dealership doesn't answer my questions?

	This should be rare, but if it happens, call your manufacturer. The recall notice should provide a customer service number. If your car has a recall, the automaker may want its VIN. If that still doesn't work, call NHTSA at 1-888-327-4236.

	Is there a deadline for me to get repairs made?

	Safety recalls are effective for the life of your car or vehicle equipment (a child seat, for example). The exception is recalls for tires, NHTSA says; those require you to get the work done within 180 days of notification.

	Are recall repairs always free?

	Not necessarily. For cars more than 15 years old when a defect is determined (e.g., a 1998 model recalled in 2015) aren't required to have a free recall, though automakers will often provide the fix for free anyway. For tires, that window of time is five years.

	What if this problem already caused damage or cost me in repairs?

	Are all recalled cars eventually fixed?

	If a manufacturer drags its feet on conducting a recall, what can NHTSA do?

	Regulators monitor recall repair rates and how effectively the repair fixes the problem. If either area is unsatisfactory, NHTSA can open an investigation and force manufacturers to expand the recall or alter the fix.

	If I rent or buy a car, how do I know it doesn't have an unfixed recall?

	Cars in Limbo

	Opponents of the bill say a ban on the sale of used cars with unfixed recalls would keep some cars in limbo for weeks waiting for parts, ultimately reducing their trade-in value.

	Older cars and those with less significant recalls have lower compliance rates for recalls, J.D. Power notes. Any prohibition on the sale of these cars ""is likely to cause substantial issues for dealers and consumers.""

	""There's just this double standard. We're in this situation because of the industry's malfeasance,"" Gillan said in an interview with us. ""And now they come running and saying, well, we don't have the parts and how can you penalize us financially?""

	Lower Trade-in Values

	Jonathan Banks, J.D. Power's vice president of vehicle analysis and analytics, told us that dealers, if they were forced to repair recalls for used cars, would likely try to determine whether the remedy was available, and, if not, calculate an expected timeframe for the remedy based on past recalls of similar complexity. Then they would try to mitigate that with lower trade-in estimates.

	""They would try to figure out a fairly complicated equation in their head as part of the trade-in process,"" said Banks, one of the study's authors. ""You tend to err on the side of being conservative and you'd try to overestimate your costs.""

	In the end, that could cost some owners more than $1,200 per affected car, J.D. Power estimated.

	The firm estimates that under a ban of used-car sales with unfixed recalls, owners who traded cars into franchised dealers with unfixed recalls in 2014 would have received, on average, $1,210 less for their trade if those dealers were barred from selling the car until its recall was fixed.

	Consumers can typically get a recall fixed for free, but it's not that easy for a dealer, Banks noted. In particular, if a consumer tried to trade in a car with an unfixed recall to a dealer from a different brand, that dealer would have to factor in the cost to ship the car over to its branded dealership to get the repair. Indeed, J.D. Power's study found that among trade-ins with unfixed recalls, dealers would give hundreds of dollars less in trade-in for an affected car from a different brand.

	J.D. Power estimates that consumers trade in around 10 million used cars into franchised dealerships each year, and from 2010 to 2014, 13.2 percent of all cars traded into franchised dealers had a recall. But in 2014, 44 percent of that group had a recall for which parts were not yet available. If a ban were in effect, that would mean that nearly 750,000 cars in 2014 that would have likely faced lower trade-in values from franchised dealers, J.D. Power said.

	Still, Gillan doesn't think consumers should have to bear the risk associated with unfixed recalls.

	""That should be a burden that's shouldered by the industry and not consumers,"" she said. ""You're asking consumers to accept that situation by putting their lives in danger, and I find that unacceptable. If the part's not available, sit down and figure out how to get that part available.""

	Critical Recalls

	At the other end of the spectrum are recalls for which a solution is already on hand. Both Banks and Allen said the vast majority of dealers fix them.

	Upended Process

	Meanwhile, ""some used-car dealers have taken steps to voluntarily agree to only sell used cars with no open recalls,"" Sen. Blumenthal's office said in an email, adding that the senator plans to reintroduce his bill in 2017. ""We must help level the playing field for these dealers that want to do the right thing.""

	Joseph Colella, a safety advocate who heads up Traffic Safety Projects, said he's ""very interested"" in closing the loophole but thinks it will be difficult.

	""NHTSA would have difficulty closing the loophole, whether mandated by Congress or not,"" Colella said in an email. The agency would need to get a cost-benefit analysis through various review agencies, including the government's budget office, before any final rule takes effect.

	Another wrinkle: The incoming administration of president-elect Donald Trump likely means a new NHTSA chief and Secretary of Transportation.

	""Today is a good time to advance the process but tomorrow may not be,"" Colella said. ""Right now, the agency is committed to recall enhancement. A new Administrator (and Secretary) means new priorities.""

	""Volkswagen is committed to ensuring that the program is now carried out as seamlessly as possible for our affected customers and has devoted significant resources and personnel to making their experience a positive one,"" said Hinrich Woebcken, CEO of Volkswagen Group of North America, in a statement. The transactions will take place at VW dealers and Robert Giuffra, VW's lead attorney, said at the earlier hearing that every dealer will have a person assigned to the settlement.

	""We are very pleased the Court has granted final approval to this historic settlement that holds Volkswagen accountable for its illegal behavior and breach of consumer trust,"" said Elizabeth Cabraser, lead attorney for the class-action plaintiffs' committee, in a statement.

	The deal calls for VW to pay as much as $14.7 billion to settle the violations by about 475,000 VW and Audi 2.0-liter four-cylinder diesel cars from the 2009 through 2015 model years. VW admitted that the engines had software that activated controls during emissions testing but turned them off on the road, allowing the cars to emit up to 40 times the legal limit of nitrogen oxide.

	The bulk of the settlement, up to about $10 billion, will go to buy back the recalled cars or to pay restitution and fix them, if a fix ever is approved. Owners opting for the buyback will get the trade-in value as of September 2015 plus a restitution payment on a sliding scale based on their car. The judge in his order noted that the settlement gives owners total payments of about 112.6 percent of their vehicle's value as of September 2015. 

	There are separate provisions for lessees, loan forgiveness and owners who sold or wrecked their vehicles since that time.

	The deadline for owners to opt out of the class-action settlement and pursue separate legal action passed on Sept. 16; Cabraser said Oct. 18 that just 3,200 people had opted out of the class settlement and that some of those have returned. 

	VW also will pay nearly $5 billion into two funds, $2.7 billion to finance federal and California pollution mitigation campaigns, and another $2 billion to support zero-emission vehicles, as with electric car charging stations. Additionally, about $600 million was set aside to settle state claims.

	""While we are now able to begin providing benefits to affected 2.0-liter owners and lessees, those with depreciated and polluting 3.0-liter vehicles deserve a similarly fair and speedy resolution,"" said Cabraser today. ""We continue our efforts on their behalf.""

The Problem: The electrical harness connector for the front passenger-seat occupant classification system may dislodge when the seat is moved. In a crash necessitating the deployment of the passenger frontal airbag, this would by default trigger only the first stage of airbag deployment whether a child is in the front seat (in which case the airbag should not deploy) or the crash is severe and both stages should deploy. Either scenario increases the risk of an injury to the front-seat occupant.

	""Far too often, people say they are unaware of open recalls on their vehicles,"" said NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas in a statement, who emphasized the administration's goal of 100 percent recall completion. ""This proposed rule would require automakers to add modern tools to the way they communicate to owners about open recalls.""

	Carmakers still would have to issue the notices via mail and the rule allows them to pick the electronic channel or channels they find most effective. Many are trying such alternatives now, at least in major recalls such as the Takata airbag campaign, and in comments ahead of the proposal, expressed preferences or reservations about particular methods.

	""We have been successful in leveraging multiple communication channels, including digital, to reach and motivate owners to get recall repairs completed. We use analytics to guide us as to which channels are most effective with different customer segments in driving repairs,"" said GM spokesman Tom Wilkinson. ""As we now all live in a digital world, it makes complete sense that we broaden our communications to include digital channels.""

	Among the ""electronic means"" NHTSA offered as options in the proposal: ""electronic mail, text messages, radio or television notifications, vehicle infotainment console messages, over-the-air alerts [to connected cars], social media or targeted online campaigns, phone calls, including automated phone calls, or other real-time means.""

	The automakers would file their proposed electronic notices with NHTSA, as they do now with the mailings, and under the proposal, they would not have to conform to a template as the mail notices do. It attempts to offer some flexibility by medium. For example, a character-limited Twitter notice could include a link to more information.

	However, NHTSA says that it retains the authority to give a thumbs up or thumbs down on compliance for the notices, and to require additional efforts.

	That is for a major recall, however, and there could be a risk that multiplying messages for lesser recalls might make owners tune out.

	Here's the problem: The chemical mixture (ammonium nitrate) that Takata used to inflate the airbags grew more unstable over time as moisture crept in, especially in regions with high heat and humidity. To combat that, Takata added what's known as a desiccant, or a moisture absorber. Now, the federal government has told Takata it must stop making all inflators with ammonium nitrate as a propellant by the end of 2018. While the jury is still out on whether Takata's newer, desiccated inflators will eventually need to be recalled and replaced, some automakers are using these airbag inflators in new cars.

	We reached out to automakers to find out which new cars are getting Takata's non-desiccated airbag inflators and which are getting desiccated inflators. Here's what we found:

	Automakers Producing New Cars With Takata's More Volatile Inflators

	Automakers Without Takata's Volatile Inflators in Their New Cars

	Spokespeople for these automakers said that none of their new cars use Takata's more volatile inflators:

	Automakers With Unclear Answers

	Takata's Less-Volatile Inflators Could Be Recalled, Too

	""NHTSA will continue to monitor the data available on desiccated inflators, while proceeding with the recalls of the non-desiccated inflators that we know present safety risks,"" the agency said in a statement to Cars.com.

	What will the feds be looking at? Jimmie Oxley, a chemistry professor at the University of Rhode Island, explained that ammonium nitrate qualifies chemically as a salt and, ""by that definition, it's pretty water-soluble,"" she said. ""It can get mushy.""

	""You know what desiccant is: If you buy a new pair of shoes, it's that square in the bottom ¨¹ that one-by-one-inch square that you pick up and throw away,"" Oxley explained. ""Sometimes it comes in a food product.""

	How effective is it? While there is no hard data yet, there are no known rupture incidents to have come from desiccated inflators, regulators say.

	""The root cause [of airbag ruptures] identified by the three independent research groups is limited to inflators without desiccant,"" NHTSA said, referring to exposure to heat and humidity over time. ""To date, there has been no known rupture of a desiccated inflator due to propellant degradation.""

	Still, Oxley notes that desiccant won't block moisture forever. She likened it to using rice grains to keep salt from caking: Over time, the effectiveness can run out.

	""Decomposition always goes on, but it's going to be minor with desiccant,"" Oxley said. ""Obviously, hot, humid weather is worse than cold weather in the [desiccated] decomposition period.""

	To test how long the desiccant remains effective, experts would need to accelerate the aging process, something, ""presumably, Takata has done,"" Oxley said. ""You take the thing up to elevated temperature, hold it for a while, and you crash it down to really cold temperature, and you temperature-cycle it.""

	But for now, there is no firm answer about the long-term safety of the desiccated inflators. Asked by Cars.com about its current testing on desiccated inflators, a Takata spokesperson said only that, under the terms of its current consent order, the supplier is testing the safety and service life ""of all inflators on the market.""

	Meanwhile, Takata's desiccated ammonium nitrate inflators appear still to be in widespread use in new vehicles for sale. Cars.com asked automakers if any of their new (2016-2017 model-year) cars have them. Here are those that responded:

	J.D. Power reports that more than 45 million vehicles recalled between 2013 and 2015 remain unfixed. That's especially alarming when you consider that it nearly matches the number of recalls for all of last year, 51 million, which was the most of any previous year. During the past two decades, annual recall tallies in the U.S. have averaged nearly 22 million for a grand total of 437 million ¨¹ and as those numbers grow, so does the frequency of inaction among owners.

	Renee Stephens, vice president of U.S. automotive for J.D. Power, said the recall-compliance study is intended to establish a context to help federal safety officials and automakers respond to this disturbing development.

	""By understanding the behavioral trends of vehicle owners, as well as recall completion rates among different vehicle and recall types, as an industry we can better tailor communications to improve those completion rates,"" Stephens said in a statement.

	Among the report's various findings, the notion that size matters is the least surprising: The bigger the recall, the more complicated it is to notify individual owners and procure the needed parts. As a result, J.D. Power found recalls affecting less than 10,000 vehicles have a 67-percent completion rate compared with recalls affecting more than a million vehicles, which have a completion rate of less than half.

	""It is sometimes difficult to obtain parts to launch large campaigns,"" J.D. Power stated. ""In addition, customers can more easily receive a targeted communication method, such as a phone call, with a smaller population of vehicles.""

	Other major factors influencing recall completion rates include vehicle age, vehicle type and the nature of the safety issue being repaired. Recalls for model-year 2013-17 vehicles are completed at a rate of 73 percent compared with just 44 percent for 2003-07 models. Meanwhile, the highest completion rates are for recalls involving powertrain, brake issues and electrical issues ¨¹ 71, 66 and 62 percent, respectively ¨¹ compared with less than 50 percent for both airbag and suspension problems. Moreover, owners of large work vans and compact premium SUVs have their vehicles remedied at a rate of 85 percent or better, while only about a third of large-SUV and sports car owners comply.

	The diesel four-cylinder at issue comes in three distinct generations. The first-generation engine, installed in various 2009-14 Volkswagen four-cylinder TDI vehicles, as well as the 2010-13 Audi A3 TDI, will get a larger catalytic converter and software updates, the AP quoted one of the dealers as saying.

	The second-generation diesel engine is in the 2012-14 Volkswagen Passat TDI; the third-gen diesel is in various model-year 2015 TDI cars. AP quoted the dealer as saying that second-generation cars will only require a software update, while third-generation cars will require a software update followed by hardware changes later on. AP went on to quote one of the two dealers as saying that in a small batch of testing, Volkswagen found the fixes did not noticeably impact gas mileage, horsepower or torque.

	A source who attended the meeting with Volkswagen executives confirmed to Cars.com that the automaker's initial testing showed minimal impact on those three factors.

	Nick Conger, an EPA spokesman, said the agency wouldn't comment on the report. A California Air Resources Board spokesperson did not immediately respond to our questions.

	Jeannine Ginivan, a VW spokeswoman, said the automaker ""cannot comment on remedies until they are approved by the regulators"" but will ""continue to work with them to find an approved remedy.""

	At the heart of the problem is nitrogen oxide, a pollutant that can cause asthma and other respiratory illnesses. Illegal software allowed the exhaust systems in Volkswagen's diesel cars to filter out enough during emissions testing to comply with EPA rules, but allowed the cars to emit much more in real driving. Lawsuits filed by three states this week allege that VW used the software in the first-gen cars; it decided not to use a bulkier and costlier urea-injection emissions system, but found the simpler catalyst system with a nitrogen oxide ""trap"" could not comply with U.S. regulations for required useful life.

	The source who attended the meeting also told Cars.com that the proposed solution involves a new nitrogen oxide trap as well as other components.

	The automaker faces deadlines between Oct. 14, 2016, and March 3, 2017, to submit fixes for its various four-cylinder diesel generations. The proposed settlement does not require Volkswagen to come up with an approved fix, but requires the automaker to repurchase affected vehicles that can't be fixed at pre-scandal values without being able to resell them afterward.

	Safety advocates have pushed for loaners and more ¨¹ and faster action by regulators and automakers ¨¹ on serious defects to meet owners' needs, while keeping unsafe vehicles off the road.

	The Center for Auto Safety called Yelchin's death ""the latest example of industry and government incompetence in the face of vehicle safety defects."" It noted that FCA was promising a fix ""in the fourth quarter"" for vehicles recalled in April and under NHTSA investigation since August 2015. It called for FCA to tell owners to park the cars until fixed, provide a detailed repair timeline, and offer loaners in the meantime or buy back the vehicles.

	""If there is imminent harm, you've got to move faster,"" said Clarence Ditlow, CAS executive director, in an interview. He believes regulators and automakers can make that happen. Noting FCA's acceleration of the shifter repair by months, he said, ""They had a fix four days after Yelchin died. They could have had it four days before. It's that simple.""

	Some automakers have provided alternative transport in the case of a major recall, but that's  rare, except for cars still under warranty, and then only for the time needed to do the actual repair. Notable exceptions:

	In both cases, these automakers have done this on their own and were not required by regulations to provide the cars. But NHTSA also encourages owners to request one in situations where they are afraid to use their vehicle.

	There are millions of vehicles in circulation with flaws potentially dangerous to drivers or passengers, and there likely will be more owners caught in such situations. Why?

	After reporting to NHTSA, the automakers then must notify owners within 60 days. And the rules specifically say that having no fix, or not knowing the cause, are not grounds to delay notification of owners. And even where a cause and fix are known, the automaker must work with suppliers to produce the parts needed to repair what can be millions of vehicles.

	In a statement, Tesla said the collision occurred on a divided highway when the semitrailer drove across the roadway, perpendicular to the Model S. Autopilot failed to perceive the white trailer against a ""brightly lit sky,"" and the driver did not brake, Tesla stated. The top of Brown's car reportedly impacted the bottom of the trailer, causing the vehicle to pass underneath.

	""Had the Model S impacted the front or rear of the trailer, even at high speed, its advanced crash safety system would likely have prevented serious injury as it has in numerous other similar incidents,"" the automaker stated, noting that it informed NHTSA of the incident immediately after it occurred.

	NHTSA acknowledged that Tesla reported the matter, beginning a process that could lead to an eventual recall centered on Autopilot, USA Today reported.

	""This preliminary evaluation is being opened to examine the design and performance of any automated driving systems in use at the time of the crash,"" NHTSA stated in its filing.

	Tesla expressed condolences to the family of Brown, who was the first known fatality in more than 130 million miles of Autopilot-activated driving. The automaker noted that among all U.S. vehicles, a fatality occurs every 94 million miles and worldwide every 60 million miles.

	Tesla also noted that the Autopilot function requires acknowledgement by the driver before it can be enabled, and that it requires drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel at all times to ""maintain control and responsibility for your vehicle.""

	""The system also makes frequent checks to ensure that the driver's hands remain on the wheel and provides visual and audible alerts if hands-on is not detected,"" Tesla stated. ""It then gradually slows down the car until hands-on is detected again.""

	Cars.com Executive Editor Joe Wiesenfelder recently experienced Tesla's Autopilot firsthand when he went for a ride in a 2016 Model S P90D equipped with the $2,500 option, and he was impressed with how well it worked. Wiesenfelder described the function as a combination of adaptive cruise control, which maintains a preset distance from the car in front of you, and an enhanced version of lane departure warning called Autosteer that doesn't just prevent wandering but actively holds the lane. The system also includes Auto Lane Change, automatic parallel and perpendicular parking, and Summon, which can move the car forward or back while the driver stands outside.

	""They actually freak out the engineers because they get so comfortable so fast that the engineer sitting beside them has to say, 'You may want to put your hands on the wheel,' "" Mark Wakefield, head of AlixPartners, the consulting firm that conducted the study, told Bloomberg.

	Tesla defended the safety of its Autopilot system and said that as more real-world miles are accumulated, the probability of incidents like the one that killed Brown will keep decreasing.

	""Autopilot is getting better all the time, but it is not perfect and still requires the driver to remain alert,"" the automaker said in a statement. ""Nonetheless, when used in conjunction with driver oversight, the data is unequivocal that Autopilot reduces driver workload and results in a statistically significant improvement in safety when compared to purely manual driving.""

	They include:

	The agency says eight of the 10 confirmed U.S. deaths from ruptured Takata airbag inflators are in this pool of cars. The risk was alarming enough for U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx to advise that owners stop driving the cars ""unless they are going straight to a dealer to have them repaired immediately.""

	NHTSA says the inflators in these cars contain a manufacturing defect that exposes them to a particularly high risk of potentially deadly ruptures. Incidents are far likelier in cars that have spent significant time in areas with high absolute humidity such as the Gulf Coast, Florida and Southern California. Laboratory tests from cars exposed to these climates showed a rupture rate as high as 50 percent, the agency said today.

	Honda implored affected owners to take their vehicle to the dealership as soon as possible and said it will continue to aggressively explore and implement new methods to reach owners of these vehicles. Honda said it has ample replacement parts inventory from alternative suppliers to immediately repair all of the recalled vehicles from the 2001-03 model years. The automaker also encouraged all affected owners to call automobile customer service at 888-234-2138 for more information.

	That's the same fly-by-wire shifter being investigated in the June 19 death of ""Star Trek"" actor Anton Yelchin, who was crushed in an apparent rollaway incident involving his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. That death still is being investigated by Los Angeles police and FCA, and is mentioned but not included in the report by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on its FCA shifter investigation.

	While the shifter activates lights in two places indicating the gear selected, the shifter itself just toggles forward and back, returning to the center after each selection. There also is a chime alert if the driver opens the door with engine still on without selecting Park. NHTSA said in its report that while the shifter ""has the familiar appearance of a conventional console mechanical gearshift assembly, it has an unfamiliar movement that does not provide the tactile or visual feedback that drivers are accustomed to receiving from conventional shifters.""

	Until the fix is made, FCA's recall notice warns drivers to take extra care to be sure the vehicles are in Park before getting out. The recalled vehicles include the model-year 2012-14 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans, and 2014-15 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs.

	Honda says it has determined that the Takata driver-side airbag inflator ruptured in a weekend crash in Malaysia that resulted in the death of the driver of a 2005 Honda City, a subcompact sedan sold primarily in emerging markets that shares a global platform with the Fit hatchback, which is sold in the U.S.

	Honda said its records show that the vehicle was included in a May 21, 2015, recall announcement for the driver-side airbag and that three notices had been sent to the owner but that it had not been repaired. The car also had been recalled for the passenger-side airbag inflator.

	Honda said it is continuing to investigate the crash, in which the cause of the woman's death is not yet official, but which was described as an otherwise ""minor crash"" in an AP report. The local Malay Mail reported that ""a projectile from the airbag"" is believed to have pierced the mother of two's chest.

	The woman's death, if confirmed, will bring the global death count linked with Takata inflator failures to 14, including 10 in the U.S. and four in Malaysia. The inflators can explode with too much force and send metal fragments at the occupants. The recall for the inflator defect is now the largest automotive recall in history, with up to 40 million vehicles affected just in the U.S.

	And so do we.

	In a statement, NHTSA said it has been in contact with authorities to determine whether Yelchin's death was the result of the gear-shifter defect. Vehicles under the recall include model-year 2012-14 Dodge Charger and Chrysler 300 sedans, and 2014-15 Jeep Grand Cherokees. NHTSA launched its initial investigation following reports of more than 300 Grand Cherokee rollaway incidents resulting in 117 crashes and 28 injuries, The Detroit News reported.

	""NHTSA initiated an investigation into the issue in February of this year. Then, in April, FCA acknowledged the defect and issued a recall at NHTSA's urging,"" safety officials stated. ""Until all of these recalled vehicles are fixed, owners should take extra care to make sure their car is in park and turned completely off before exiting.""

	In a statement on Monday, FCA extended its condolences to Yelchin's friends and family, and said the automaker is in contact with authorities and conducting a thorough investigation.

	""It is premature to speculate on the cause of this tragedy,"" FCA stated.

	FCA reportedly sent out recall notices for the gear-selector issue in mid-May with a targeted fix by July or August, The Detroit News reported. It should be noted that the problem under recall isn't an equipment malfunction, but instead a design that NHTSA has deemed ""not intuitive"" and one that provides ""poor tactile and visual feedback to the driver.""

	Instead of a conventional gear-shifter design that, for example, slides along a track and clicks into varied positions, FCA's electronic selector snaps back into a central position upon selection and that position is indicated by lights; chimes should also sound if the driver opens the door while the vehicle is not in Park. FCA began replacing the gear selector with a new design in 2015.

	In February, when news of FCA's rollaway issues was emerging, Cars.com editors sounded off on electronic gear selectors offered by several automakers, including FCA. Some felt they were an ergonomic annoyance but not necessarily a safety risk, while others saw the potential for danger.

The Problem: The monostable gear selector may mislead owners about which gear the vehicle is in and may not adequately warn the driver when the driver's door is opened and the vehicle is not in Park. This could result in drivers exiting the vehicle while it is still in gear; they could be struck and injured if they attempt to get out of the vehicle while the engine is running and the brake is not engaged.

	This latest action is an expansion of Maserati parent Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' recall of nearly 812,000 vehicles for the same issue with the electronic gear selector and the resulting rollaway danger. The problem has been implicated in hundreds of rollaway incidents and crashes, and dozens of injuries. Most recently, ""Star Trek"" star Anton Yelchin died Sunday after being pinned by his 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee; authorities were investigating whether the shifter issue was the cause. Following Yelchin's death, FCA announced that it was accelerating its related recall fix by several months.

The Fix: Dealers will perform a software update for free. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted that the software remedy is currently in development.

What Owners Should Do: The automaker will begin notifying owners on July 1. A second notification will be mailed when the software update is available. Owners can call Maserati at 201-510-2369, NHTSA's vehicle-safety hotline at 888-327-4236 or go to www.safercar.gov for more info.

	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has pushed to make all inflator recalls national in scope, but it's conducting the latest expansion ""in a phased approach"" among three zones based on humidity, the agency told Cars.com today.

	Experts link the crisis to high absolute humidity, which can lead to moisture buildup over time in Takata inflators and cause them to rupture when the airbag deploys.

	Here's the breakdown of this week's recalls; all are for front passenger-side Takata airbag inflators.

	Ferrari

	Ferrari will recall the following cars, but NHTSA did not specify geographic zones:

	Dates of manufacture by month are printed on a sticker in the driver's door jamb.

	Fiat Chrysler Automobiles

	Honda

	Mazda

	Mitsubishi

	Mitsubishi will recall the following cars, though NHTSA did not specify geographic regions:

	Dates of manufacture by month are printed on a sticker in the driver's door jamb.

	In addition, FCA is recalling the Mitsubishi Raider pickup truck, a corporate sibling to the Dodge Dakota, for the 2006-2008 model years in all three zones. FCA is recalling the Raider for the 2009 model year in zones A and B only.

	Nissan

	Subaru

	Toyota

	Weren't These Cars Already Recalled?

	""A lot of these have already been recalled because the vast majority of the recall before May 4 ¨¹ the 29 million [inflators] ¨¹ were for driver-side airbags,"" NHTSA communications director Bryan Thomas explained. ""The vast majority of these new ones are passenger side.""

	That means many owners are going to get a new notice to have their Takata inflator replaced, but for a different airbag.

	Documents posted by NHTSA say Subaru's campaign covers cars not recalled in prior campaigns. This week's expansion doesn't duplicate anything, Thomas said.

	""These are, in fact, new recalls,"" Thomas told us. ""The passenger-side recalls that were done before this month were never comprehensive. It was some models of Takata inflators, and now we're capturing all the non-desiccated frontal airbag inflators. What makes this really complicated is that even within one make-model-year-type vehicle, you may have more than one type of inflator.""

	That's even before geography comes into play. In NHTSA's phased approach, Zone A includes model-year 2011 or older cars. Zone B has model-year 2008 or older cars, while Zone C has 2004 or older cars.

	It won't stay that way, however. Earlier model years ""may only be under immediate recall in Zone A, and would be subject to recall in Zones B and C at a later date"" according to the schedule laid out to Takata, NHTSA said.

	This isn't the end, either.

	""The filings posted today do not represent all the filings that NHTSA expects pertaining to this recall expansion,"" the agency said. ""We anticipate posting more of the OEM DIRs [defect information reports, a part of the recall process] next week.""

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 80,000 model-year 2013-14 Nissan Pathfinder SUVs manufactured between June 20, 2012, and June 13, 2013

The Problem: The brake light switch may have been installed incorrectly, causing the relay to make intermittent contact and repeatedly cycle. This may result in the relay remaining in the On position and causing the brake lights to remain illuminated even when the brakes are not applied. If not fixed, following vehicles may not stop when the brakes are applied, increasing the risk of a crash. In addition, the brake light switch may interfere with the brake-shift interlock, allowing the driver to shift the vehicle out of the Park position without depressing the brake pedal and increasing the risk of injury during a rollaway.

The Fix: Dealers will inspect the brake light switch and, if necessary, replace the relay for free.

	""I need to fault myself for a little bit of hubris for putting too much technology all at once into a product,"" said Musk, speaking at the Tesla annual shareholder meeting this week at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif. ""In retrospect, the right thing to do with the Model X would have been to take a lot of the really awesome, cool things but kind of table them ... for Version 2 and Version 3 instead of piling all of them in Version 1.""

	Regarding the doors, Musk said that ""getting the complex set of sensors to work well has been incredibly difficult to refine. I think we're almost there in making the doors useful.

	""It's a software problem. It's figuring out, how do you interpret all the information from the sensors? What should you remember? What shouldn't you remember? How should you open the door in different circumstances, if you're in a low ceiling or a narrow situation? If the sensor is giving erroneous feedback, when is the right time to ignore the sensor?

	""... Digging ourselves out of the hole has been quite, quite hard,"" he added.

	Musk promised that over-the-air software updates now and ""in about a month"" will get the doors right.

	""Finally we'll be at the point where the doors are better than normal doors, as opposed to worse,"" he said, adding, ""If you order a Model X now or soon, trust me, you will love the doors because the software will actually be right.""

The Problem: The driver frontal airbag may improperly inflate during second-stage deployment during a high-speed crash, increasing the risk of an injury.

The Problem: Wire-harness terminals may lose their electrical connections and the vehicle's shifter may become locked in Park or Neutral once the vehicle is stopped.

The Problem: The buckle on the impact protection shield, which is used when the seat is in toddler car seat mode and not booster mode, may only partially engage, giving caregivers a false impression that the buckle is fully latched when it is not. If the buckle is only partially engaged, the child will be unrestrained in a crash.

The Fix: The manufacturer has not yet released a solution for the problem. ""We would recommend not using the car seat if the impact shield is still being used. If the seat is being used without the impact shield, it is safe to use,"" Connie Sauernheimer of Kiddy USA told Cars.com.

	Nissan can't yet tell dealers which particular cars are affected, he added.

	""If there's no lights on and it seems to be acting properly when an adult is sitting in the car, we're not advising them to get out of the seat and sit in the back,"" Yaeger said.

	Other Questions

	Subaru blames an incorrect setting for a tool used to build the steering column, according to NHTSA documents. That could result in faulty machining of a steering-column shaft; in such cases, the shaft may not engage properly, which could allow the steering wheel to rotate freely.

	""We're fixing cars on the dealer lots right now,"" McHale said. ""If a car doesn't have it [the defect], it's available for sale. If a car has it, then we're fixing [it].""

	McHale said that means shoppers should still find buyable cars, particularly ones that have been deemed defect-free after an inspection.

	The question is how long it will take Subaru to have enough replacement parts. McHale said he didn't have an answer for that yet.

	But the German automaker says it bundled the ICCT notice to Winterkorn with his ""extensive"" weekend memos, and it's unknown how much the CEO ¨¹ who resigned in September 2015, just days after the scandal broke ¨¹ noticed. It plays into VW's broader narrative of the scandal, which it framed as an issue that received no special attention from its leadership for more than a year.

	VW disclosed the details in a statement this week that responds to allegations that it violated German law by failing to disclose information before the crisis broke.

	VW says those employees are ""still being determined"" but were below the automaker's management board.

	""According to current knowledge, the diesel matter, as it was treated as one of many product issues facing the Company, did not initially receive particular attention at the management levels of Volkswagen,"" the automaker said in the statement.

	If you've been following the Volkswagen Group's diesel crisis, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer had ordered the company to report by today on a plan to fix the emissions systems in nearly 600,000 U.S. diesel cars from the 2009 to 2016 model years. The company has been sued by the government. It also faces hundreds of suits from consumers for the cheating; the suits have been consolidated under Breyer.

	In granting the extension, the judge cited ""substantial progress"" by VW and regulators toward a solution, according Volkswagen spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan. Details of that progress, however, were not made public.

	In a statement, the company said that it ""is committed to resolving the U.S. regulatory investigation into the diesel emissions matter as quickly as possible and to implementing a solution for affected vehicles."" It also said that it is ""cooperating fully"" with Breyer ""to bring about a prompt and fair resolution"" of the consumer lawsuits.

	Volkswagen installed ""defeat device"" software in the cars that allowed them to pass emission tests but switched off in real-world driving. The result is better fuel mileage and performance but significantly greater emissions. The company has halted sales of its vehicles with its four- or six-cylinder diesels since the cheating was revealed last year.

	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration posted notices this week from German auto supplier Continental that some of its airbag control units ¨¹ each of which controls all the airbags in a vehicle ¨¹ are susceptible to corrosion in the components that power them. That, in turn, could cause the airbags and possibly the seat belt pretensioners (which tighten your belt at impact) to fail to deploy or ¨¹ for at least two automakers ¨¹ deploy when they shouldn't.

	In the Jan. 25 notice to NHTSA, Continental listed six automakers that had purchased the defective controllers: Honda, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Mercedes-Benz, Mazda, Volkswagen Group and Volvo Trucks, a maker of heavy commercial vehicles unrelated to the Volvo car company.

	Beyond that, Continental did not specify the cars involved. ""As a supplier, we have provided all the pertinent information to all potentially impacted vehicle manufacturers,"" Arraf said. ""Each manufacturer determines whether a safety-related defect exists in their vehicles.""

	Automakers that have issued vehicle recalls for the component so far:

	Spokespeople for all three automakers confirmed these recalls are part of Continental's larger airbag control unit recall.

	To fix the problem, dealers will replace the defective airbag control units. But the question is when?

	""We are ramping up production of the service part and are working individually with each customer to determine time and volume,"" Arraf said. However, Continental has not yet provided a notification schedule to automakers, according to NHTSA.

	Honda said parts won't be available until this fall, and neither FCA nor Mercedes-Benz provided a replacement schedule.

	Also, the vehicle recalls announced so far add up to fewer than 600,000 cars. Where are the rest?

	The cars involved include many popular nameplates, from the Fit subcompact to the CR-V SUV. Here's the full list of this week's expansion:

	The latest expansion affects a more recent batch of cars than Honda had previously included in its Takata airbag recalls, which primarily involved a range of 2001-2008 Honda and Acura cars. The inclusion of 2015 and 2016 vehicles also extends beyond Takata's two defect reports filed Jan. 25, which said the total batch of recalled vehicles extended only to 2014. That means it's possible that once all automakers report their cars involved in the Jan. 22 announcement, the total could extend past 5 million airbags.

	Consistent with Takata's earlier filings, the National Highway Traffic Safety Association says the driver's-side airbag inflators can deploy with too much force and rupture, sending metal fragments into occupants. Honda will install new inflators in the affected cars for free, but the automaker says parts won't be available until summer because of how many cars are involved.

	Honda has said in the past that it will provide loaner cars for owners with vehicles under Takata recall if parts are not yet available. It appears that could be the case for six months or longer.

	Owners will get an initial recall letter, plus a second notification once parts become available, starting with older cars in regions with high absolute humidity. All airbags nationwide will eventually be recalled. Takata has found ruptures in test cases, but regulators have documented no real-world incidents with this group of cars, according to NHTSA filings.

	Separately, Automotive News reported Wednesday that a memo Honda sent to dealers mandated a stop-sale order on affected cars, new or used. The memo said dealers will be responsible for any claims that stem from selling an unrepaired car that's affected, the newspaper said. Federal law prohibits dealers from selling new cars that have unrepaired recalls, but it allows dealers to sell used cars that have them.

	Honda spokesman Chris Martin confirmed the dealer memo as well as the stop-sale order, which he said is Honda's protocol with any recall that involves cars likely to be among dealer's new or certified pre-owned inventory. It applies to all cars, regardless of status: ""Our dealer agreements require repair of all recalls before vehicle sale for any new or used vehicle. They don't have to be certified,"" Martin said.

The Problem: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is conducting a voluntary recall to supply wheel chocks for the affected vehicles. Per instructions in the vehicle's owner's manual, the chocks are employed when using a tire jack to change wheels. When positioned diagonally opposite the wheel being changed, the chocks help stabilize the vehicle. FCA says failure to follow the manual's instructions may cause the vehicle to come off of the tire jack. The automaker said it is aware of three minor injuries related to this issue.

	The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration today added about 5 million airbag inflators to the growing list of Takata airbag recalls, and said three additional brands ¨¹ Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen ¨¹ will become part of the massive ongoing action. This latest recall expansion comes after the recent death of a pickup truck driver in South Carolina, which brings the total related U.S. fatalities to nine among the 10 worldwide.

	It was not immediately clear which specific car models would be under recall. NHTSA is receiving two specific filings from Takata, spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told reporters in a conference call today. Both filings involve driver's-side airbags.

	Cautioning that its findings are preliminary and ""subject to significant change,"" Trowbridge said the first recall expansion ¨¹ of around 1 million cars ¨¹ involves vehicles from Audi, Volkswagen, Daimler vans, Ford, a small number of Mazda B-Series pickup trucks and ""some Saab vehicles."" The second expansion, covering around 4 million cars, also involves Volkswagen, BMW, Honda and Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

	The first recall expansion stemmed from testing on a 2006 Ford Ranger pickup truck in which a motorist recently died in South Carolina. The second expansion stemmed from airbag testing on Toyota RAV4 SUVs.

	The Ford incident would mark the 10th global death among about 100 injuries from the rupturing airbags, whose defective inflators come from supplier Takata Corp. In a statement to Cars.com, Ford said it's ""working with the agency to review the available information, but we have very limited information at this point.""

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 340,000 model-year 2008-10 Honda Accord sedans

The Problem: Manufacturing-process issues may allow moisture to enter the circuitry within the electric control unit of the supplemental restraint system, which over time could cause corrosion and eventual malfunction of the unit. If this occurs, the SRS indicator will illuminate on the vehicle's dashboard and, in a crash, the airbags may not deploy, increasing the risk of an injury. Honda has confirmed two injuries related to the problem. This is unrelated to the ongoing Takata airbag recall.

The Fix: Dealers will install a new SRS control unit for free.

What Owners Should Do: Honda will begin notifying owners in mid-March. Due to the large volume, the necessary parts will not be available until fall, so the automaker will send a second notification when parts are available. In the interim Honda advises that if the SRS indicator on the instrument panel in front of the driver (not to be confused with the passenger airbag off indicator in the central dashboard area), owners should visit a dealer for a diagnostic check. If the check indicates the defect is present, the SRS electronic control unit will be replaced for free at that time using a limited supply of updated parts.

	It's the latest development in a massive crisis for Takata, a major automotive supplier. When exposed to high heat and humidity for long periods, Takata's ammonium nitrate airbag inflators can cause a reaction that propels metal shrapnel into occupants as the airbags deploy.

	'Safety Margin Model Years'

	So far, faulty inflators have prompted recalls under NHTSA's safety margin model years, spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told reporters during a press conference. That means if Takata airbag inflators rupture during testing in a given model year for a given car, NHTSA orders a recall for that particular year plus a few surrounding years if those vehicles have the same Takata inflators.

	NHTSA says it has found five new passenger-side inflators that ruptured under testing for cars under recall, but extending the margin around the new years meant adding four more cars to the recall list:

	All four recalls involve passenger-side airbags. Subaru had not yet previously involved the 2006-2008 Legacy or Outback under its Takata recalls, but the CR-V and Mazda6 were already under other Takata recalls.

	Such is the complexity of one of the largest recalls in U.S. history. The Takata recalls involve some 23 million inflators (virtually all of them for frontal airbags) in 19 million cars from 11 automakers.

	Trowbridge said he anticipates the latest group will add ""a few hundred thousand vehicles"" to the total but cautioned that ""the math here is fairly complicated. Some of these vehicles have been covered by previous recalls. Some of them may be covered by previous driver's-side recalls. ... In some of these cases we're going to be asking them to take action twice.""

	The actual total could be considerably higher than Trowbridge's estimate. In a separate statement, Honda said the CR-V addition accounted for 127,000 new inflators, and Subaru spokesman Michael McHale told Cars.com that Subaru's expansion amounts to 340,000 new cars.

	""We should have recall defect information reports from the three affected manufacturers processed and made public hopefully in the next couple of days,"" Trowbridge said. ""We're still processing this data. It is subject to change and refinement.""

	However, NHTSA's safety margin means additional model years that still employ the same Takata inflators may not be under recall. Trowbridge noted ""there are a handful of models and model years that meet that definition.""

	New Death Linked

	Experts say the risk of an inflator rupture is highest in regions of high absolute humidity, but recalled cars can still carry the risk long after moving away. Case in point: NHTSA believes a faulty Takata inflator is responsible for a new death from a ruptured driver's-side airbag in July 2015. The crash involved a recalled 2001 Honda Accord in Pennsylvania ¨¹ an area with low absolute humidity, but from a car that ""had spent several years in the Gulf Coast region,"" Trowbridge said.

	That potentially raises the Takata toll to eight U.S. deaths plus another one worldwide, along with about 100 injuries.

	By March 2016, NHTSA will require all automakers to have enough parts on hand to repair inflators in high-humidity regions. NHTSA anticipates automakers will be on track to meet that target, and about 70 percent of the replacement inflators come from non-Takata suppliers.

	NHTSA says Takata is the only automaker that uses ammonium nitrate as the primary inflator propellant. Barring new evidence, the agency will eventually compel Takata to recall all ammonium nitrate inflators ¨¹ a move that will add ""tens of millions of inflators"" to the recall pool down the road, Trowbridge said.

	According to the just-released J.D. Power 2016 U.S. Auto Avoider Study, reliability has risen sharply in terms of how it influences car shoppers, with 55 percent of new-car shoppers citing it as a leading reason for their purchase. That's compared with reliability cited 51 percent of the time last year and just 48 percent three years ago. Moreover, 17 percent of shoppers report reliability issues as a reason to avoid certain models versus 14 percent the previous year.

	""Study findings show that buyers who avoid models for reliability reasons tend to also have concerns regarding resale value, cost of maintenance and even safety,"" J.D. Power said in a statement, noting the ""ripple effect"" of reliability issues.

	A 2014 study, however, showed that automaker recalls were increasingly on consumers' minds, with 60 percent of people in the market for a new car demonstrating awareness of specific recalls in the preceding two months. This latest J.D. Power study, now in its 13th year and conducted between July and September 2015, surveyed more than 26,000 vehicle owners who registered a new car in April and May 2015.

	""In fact, gas mileage has reached a five-year low as a reason to purchase a specific model,"" J.D. Power stated. ""It is also cited less frequently as a reason to reject other models that were considered.""

	Despite reliability's influential gains, exterior and interior styling unsurprisingly remain the two biggest factors. Exterior styling was cited 59 percent of the time as the top reason shoppers select a certain car, and also the top reason they dismiss one, with 31 percent saying so. Interior styling and price were also top turnoffs, with 18 percent each.

	According to letters sent to VW on Sept. 18, 2015, from the Environmental Protection Agency and the California Air Resources Board, here's a deeper dive on what happened. When the EPA conducts emissions testing, automakers have to disclose ""auxiliary emissions control devices,"" according to the EPA's letter. These AECDs affect a car's emissions system based on situational factors, such as how hard the engine is running or how hot it is. The EPA calls AECDs ""defeat devices"" only if they reduce the effectiveness of emissions controls outside of testing parameters and are not necessary for safety or engine startup.

	 

	The software uses ""dyno"" and ""road"" calibrations that read when an emissions test is being conducted; when the car is not being tested, the ""road"" calibration dials back the effectiveness of two types of emissions-treatment systems: nitrogen oxide traps and selective catalytic reduction (a urea solution). When dialed back, the systems allow the engine to emit nitrogen oxide levels that are 10 to 40 times the allowable amount by the EPA.

	Matthias Muller is named Volkswagen CEO. Muller says in a press release, ""My most urgent task is to win back trust for the Volkswagen Group ¨¹ by leaving no stone unturned and with maximum transparency, as well as drawing the right conclusions from the current situation. Under my leadership, Volkswagen will do everything it can to develop and implement the most stringent compliance and governance standards in our industry."" Muller will remain chairman of Porsche until a successor is found.

	NHTSA says the Mini Hardtop Cooper failed an October 2014 side-impact crash test to determine whether it met minimum crashworthiness standards. BMW Group, which owns Mini, told regulators that the Cooper had an incorrect weight rating and would pass a test conducted at the proper rating. The automaker agreed to correct the rating on the Cooper's doorjamb sticker and issue a voluntary service campaign to improve side-impact protection.

	Nine months later, NHTSA retested a Cooper with the upgraded side-impact protection at the correct weight rating, but the car still failed. According to NHTSA, BMW hadn't launched the service campaign that it said it would. The agency says BMW has been late to notify owners and dealers of recalls multiple times since 2012, and has filed late recall-completion reports.

	NHTSA says BMW violated the Motor Vehicle Safety Act, which gives an automaker five days to issue a recall after it discovers a safety defect. The agency says it will require BMW to take steps to address practices that led to the misconduct, as well as submit to additional oversight and create a plan to deter BMW dealers from selling cars with unrepaired recalls. (NHTSA says that during its investigation, it was able to purchase a BMW with an unrepaired recall.) The automaker can avoid half the penalty if it complies with a consent order and avoids committing other safety violations.

The automaker has documented nearly 1,350 fires in cars that were fixed in the earlier recalls, GM said in the Wednesday memo. The vast majority (about 85 percent) occurred when the car was empty. Some of the recalled cars were also built after 2004, but GM says it made material changes to the valve covers to reduce the chance of fire.

	GM claims the defect caused 19 reported injuries but no deaths during the past six years. The automaker says the cars are still safe to drive.

The Problem: The power window master switch may have been manufactured with insufficient lubricant grease. If not enough grease is applied, under certain conditions the switch may develop a short circuit that can cause the switch assembly to overheat and melt, which could produce smoke and potentially lead to a fire. This action is an expansion of a previous recall involving model-year 2007-09 vehicles for a similar problem.

The Problem: Due to an excessive amount of grease at the contact points inside the ignition switch during production, as a result of time and use the grease may carbonize and accumulate between the contact points, reducing the electrical insulation performance inside the switch. As a result, continuous use may lead to contact points of the thermal base of the switch to become conductive, which may overheat the switch; if this occurs, the switch may smoke and possibly cause a fire. Mazda noted that once the vehicle is running, the problem does not directly affect drivability, operation or safety features, and that no related accidents or injuries have been reported.

The Fix: Dealers will make the necessary repairs for free.

38,https://www.cars.com/articles/takata-recall-update-many-affected-airbag-inflators-not-yet-replaced-1420682561322/,Takata Recall Update: Many Affected Airbag Inflators Not Yet Replaced,"
	The crisis involves faulty airbag inflators from supplier Takata Corp., which can inflate with too much pressure and send metal shrapnel into vehicle occupants. It affects cars from 10 U.S. automakers plus two commercial-vehicle manufacturers, and NHTSA has linked the problem to 98 injuries and seven U.S. deaths. (Investigators have linked an eighth death internationally.)

	The agency still targets a 100 percent replacement rate nationwide, but it's unclear how long that will take. NHTSA is looking at whether it needs to accelerate the recalls ¨¹ and how to do that, given replacement inflators ""simply won't be available within the next month, or even the next six months,"" acting enforcement administrator Frank Borris said.

	Jennifer Timian, who heads NHTSA's recall management division, said the recalls are ""making progress, and the overall completion rates are constantly improving,"" but added that the ""remedy completion rates are simply not good enough.""

	Amid manufacturing complexities, the production of replacement parts has been slow.

	""Because the system is vehicle-specific, you just can't take a part designed for car A and put it into car B,"" said Stephen Ridella, NHTSA's vehicle crashworthiness director. ""You can design an inflator from company X to go into a Takata airbag unit, but it has to be specifically designed for that specific unit. Development needs to be done, and that takes time.""

	Ridella laid out a number of options to speed the process, including further coordination with Takata and other airbag suppliers to get more replacement parts into the pipeline and authorizing independent mechanics ¨¹ not just dealerships ¨¹ to make the repairs.

	NHTSA chief Mark Rosekind said the agency will have a decision on if and how it plans to accelerate the process by Thanksgiving.

	Some Replacements the Same as the Old Ones

	Takata has contracted with at least three other airbag manufacturers ¨¹ Autoliv, Daicel and ZF-TRW ¨¹ to help build replacement inflators, NHTSA officials said. Combined, the three other manufacturers supplied 70 percent of the inflators inside Takata's ""inflator kits"" ¨¹ a new inflator plus all associated mounting hardware ¨¹ it shipped this month.

	Some of those kits have the exact same inflator as the faulty one, however.

	The situation is ""not ideal,"" Ridella said, but officials want to reset the clock on long-term humidity exposure while Takata finds a longer-term solution because ""currently there is no alternative available for these vehicles.""

	That means certain consumers will have to get a replacement twice. It's a situation that's ""a recipe for confusion,"" Rosekind conceded, but officials insisted that consumers should get it done anyway.

	""This temporary replacement is safer than the older part in their vehicle because it is new, and it has not been exposed to the environmental factors that are believed to be related to the ruptures,"" Timian said. Consumers should ""not skip the interim remedy, thinking that you'll just wait for the final remedy. Similarly, do not get the interim remedy and decide that you don't want to bother with going back for the second time for the final remedy. These are both bad ideas. The interim remedy is much safer than the original inflator part, but it will still eventually have the chance of rupture. The final remedy, once available, will be safe.""

	It's unclear how many of these interim inflators are part of the larger pool.

	NHTSA has ""not determined how many remedies will be interim because we haven't concluded which Takata inflators, if any, will meet our requirement of a safe inflator for the life of the vehicle,"" spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told us.

	Side Airbags, Too

	A Volkswagen spokesman told Cars.com he has ""not heard anything further"" about the Tiguan investigation, but NHTSA grouped it today with the GM incident.

	The agency notes that the newest airbags under investigation are ""SSI-20"" devices. It has ordered dozens of automakers and airbag-inflator manufacturers to inform NHTSA of ""any credible report of an inflator rupture,"" said Scott Yon, chief of the vehicle integrity division in NHTSA's Office of Defects Investigation. ""Based on these events, the SSI-20 inflator is now part of the Takata investigation, and NHTSA will continue to keep a close eye on this matter to ensure that all SSI-20 inflators that could have this problem are taken out of vehicles.""

	Trowbridge said he didn't have a total number of SSI-20 inflators in circulation.

	Takata would not comment specifically on the Volkswagen or GM situations, both of which NHTSA tied to SSI-20 inflators. The company issued a statement to Cars.com that it's still investigating what happened in both side-impact airbag deployments.

	""While we are still investigating the cause of this malfunction, we believe it is unrelated to the previous recalls, which the extensive data suggests were a result of aging and long-term exposure to heat and high humidity,"" Takata said. ""We are cooperating closely with NHTSA and the vehicle manufacturers.""

	Loaner Vehicles 'Appropriate'

	Rosekind noted that some automakers have made free loaner vehicles available to any consumers awaiting replacement parts who don't want to drive their cars.

	Cars.com asked every automaker involved in the Takata recall if it offers free loaner vehicles to owners waiting to get their vehicles repaired. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, Honda, Nissan, Subaru and Toyota all said they do. GM said it does in areas of high absolute humidity. Ford said it does not. BMW, Mazda and Mitsubishi did not immediately respond.

	NHTSA appears to favor them: ""It would be appropriate for manufacturers to consider doing [loaner vehicles] during this time,"" Rosekind said.

	President and CEO of Volkswagen Group of America Michael Horn appeared Thursday before the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee, withdrawing from emissions-certification consideration suspect 2016 diesel models in the wake of the automaker's diesel scandal. Without certification by the federal government, those vehicles cannot be sold in the U.S.

	Horn outlined a five-step plan the company will follow to try to remedy the situation. It includes:

	The VW diesel crisis is ""fundamentally contrary to Volkswagen's core principles of providing value to our customers, innovation, and responsibility to our communities and the environment,"" Horn said in his statement.

	""It is inconsistent that the company involved in this emissions issue is also a company that has invested in environmental efforts to reduce the carbon footprint in our factories around the world,"" he continued.

	Elsewhere, VW CEO Matthias Muller in an interview Wednesday announced plans to launch a recall in January of millions of cars around the world involved in the automaker's diesel-emissions testing crisis.

	""It's not for the U.S. market,"" VW spokesman John Schilling told Cars.com in an email. ""We have not announced our remedy here yet nor a timeline. Still pending.""

	The software was used to circumvent EPA emissions inspections of its diesel engines in the U.S. No single solution will solve every problem due to varied transmissions and country-specific designs, VW officials say. Potential fixes range from a simple software update up to major parts replacements.

	The automaker reportedly has earmarked $7.3 billion to cover recall expenses and other measures to win back consumer trust, though that amount could pale in comparison to a possible $18 billion EPA fine. VW has stated publicly that it will postpone or cancel all nonessential investments and redirect financial resource to this effort.

	While many people believe that diesels are popular mostly among European luxury vehicles and large American pickup trucks, automakers such as GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles build diesel sedans and smaller trucks for the U.S. market. Do those smaller diesels comply with U.S. emissions standards?

	We asked every major automaker that makes a diesel vehicle in the U.S. if it's confident in its compliance with emissions standards. They all denied using defeat devices.

	""Jaguar Land Rover does not use any emissions 'defeat' devices or software on its vehicles to falsely pass emissions tests,"" JLR spokesman Nathan Hoyt told us. ""We're confident that they will be fully compliant with all EU and U.S. emissions regulations.""

	BMW models ""are not equipped with systems specifically designed to force engines to work differently in test modes to meet EPA requirements,"" spokeswoman Rebecca Kiehne said.

	In a statement to Cars.com, Mercedes-Benz said it ""does not use defeat devices, which illegally limit the effectiveness of the exhaust after-treatment system. This applies to every Mercedes-Benz diesel and gasoline engine worldwide.""

	Ford spokesman Said Deep said the automaker's ""vehicles and engines meet all applicable emissions standards, and they are designed to perform consistently both in the lab and on the road."" Ford does not employ any defeat devices, Deep added.

The Problem: In certain driving conditions when using the automatic engine stop-start function, the starter motor fuse may blow, preventing the car from restarting when necessary. If the vehicle is unexpectedly unable to be started while in traffic, such as when stopped at an intersection, the risk of a crash increases.

The Fix: Dealers will replace the existing starter motor fuse with a higher-amperage fuse for free.

40,https://www.cars.com/articles/epa-to-test-other-diesels-1420681265599/,EPA to Test Other Diesels,"
	In a conference call to reporters this morning, EPA officials said they plan to spot-check other light-duty diesel vehicles for compliance with the Clean Air Act. The agency is notifying ""all automakers that we are stepping up"" oversight, said Janet McCabe, acting assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Air and Radiation.

	In the past, the agency has focused its emissions testing on nitrogen oxide on heavy-duty trucks at highway speeds, whose emissions ""dwarf"" light-duty vehicles, EPA officials said. Nitrogen oxide is the component in Volkswagen's diesel engines that the automaker allegedly evaded emissions testing on.

	""Today we're putting vehicle manufacturers on notice that our testing is now going to include additional evaluations and tests designed to look for 'defeat devices,' "" said Chris Grundler, director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air Quality. The agency isn't going to tell automakers what the additional tests are, Grundler said. It's ""actively recruiting light-duty diesel"" vehicles for testing.

	EPA, the California Air Resources Board and Canadian environmental officials are starting the testing now. Regulators plan to test all light-duty diesel vehicles on the market, Grundler told reporters, including models ""already on the road.""

	""We are dividing the work up with our partners,"" he said. ""We're going to be doing it as soon as possible.""

	In the call, the agency also shed light on why VW's fix might take up to a year. The automaker's pool of four-cylinder diesel vehicles from the 2009-2015 model years span three generations of diesel emissions systems: an earlier system with nitrogen-oxide traps plus two generations with urea (AdBlue) injection. The urea systems should have fixes relatively soon, Grundler said, but the earlier systems with nitrogen-oxide traps ""will require additional engineering"" that could drag out the process.

	The EPA ""cannot say at this point"" whether the fix will encumber fuel economy, Grundler added.

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 283,000 model-year 1998-2003 Ford Windstar minivans manufactured between Sept. 2, 1997, and July 3, 2003, at the Oakville Assembly Plant in Ontario, all of which received rear axle reinforcement brackets during a previous recall action

The Problem: The combined effects of corrosion and stress can lead to cracks in the axle, which if undetected can grow and result in a complete fracture. A previous recall repair of these vehicles included the installation of a rear axle reinforcement bracket. An incorrectly installed bracket could limit the effectiveness of that repair. Ford said it is aware of a ""small number of accidents that might be connected to this issue, but no injuries.""

The Fix: Dealers will inspect the brackets to determine if they were correctly installed, and the automaker will install a new axle on vehicles that have the incorrectly installed bracket, for free; owners of vehicles with the correctly installed bracket will receive an incentive to replace their rear axle at a reduced cost; the offer is good for one year with unlimited mileage.

41,https://www.cars.com/articles/volkswagen-diesel-recall-what-we-know-1420681234684/,Volkswagen Diesel Recall: What We Know,"
	Volkswagen has ordered dealers to stop selling both new 2015 diesel 2.0-liter four-cylinder models and certain affected certified pre-owned used models, the automaker said Monday. The order comes amid an EPA investigation regarding software placed into the cars that was allegedly used to evade emissions testing.

	VW spokesman John Schilling confirmed the stoppage and said he doesn't know how many cars it affects. However, one of three dealerships contacted in the Chicago area, where Cars.com is based, said they're still selling diesels, despite ""a lot of bad rumors."" Two other dealerships confirmed the sales stoppage.

	VW's diesel four-cylinder engine accounts for about a third of Golf inventory on Cars.com; for Jetta, it's 14.1 percent and for Passat, it's 18.7 percent.

	Federal and California certification on the 2016 four-cylinder diesels is ""still being evaluated,"" Schilling said. Those models are not yet for sale.

	Stay tuned. The affected cars will reportedly undergo a formal recall, and regulators have already issued a non-compliance notice to the automaker. VW has yet to issue a recall or say how it will fix the problem.

	In a statement released Sunday, VW CEO Martin Winterkorn said he's ""deeply sorry that we have broken the trust of our customers and the public."" The automaker says it will cooperate with authorities and has ordered an external investigation on the issue. The automaker could face criminal prosecution and fines of up to $18 billion, reports say.

	Owners ""should know that although these vehicles have emissions exceeding standards, these violations do not present a safety hazard and the cars remain legal to drive and resell,"" the EPA said in a statement Friday. ""Owners of cars of these models and years do not need to take any action at this time.""

	The EPA says its allegations affect 482,000 diesel VW and Audi cars sold over seven model years (from 2009 to 2015). Twenty-three percent of Volkswagen's August sales were diesels, the automaker said on Sept. 1.

	The agency assured VW diesel owners that it won¨¹t confiscate their vehicles, and said owners don¨¹t have to stop driving them. It said the eventual fix will be free, but owners can¨¹t turn off the defeat device on their own right now, as it's embedded in software.

	A looming question, however, is whether ¨¹ or how ¨¹ the software fix will affect engine performance or gas mileage. Spokespeople at the California Air Resources Board and the EPA would not comment, and Volkswagen spokesman John Schilling said it's ""too early to comment on the fix"" because the automaker is ""still developing"" it.

The Problem: The Automatic Occupant Sensing system may fail to suppress the front passenger airbag if a child is in the front passenger seat; if that airbag deploys with a child-safety seat in the front passenger seat, it increases the risk of injury to the child.

The Problem: The integral steel cable that secures the rubber seal to the bulkhead might have been damaged due to the supplier rework of the seal. If the rubber seal is not properly secured around the engine compartment, it is possible for the seal to temporarily stick to the hood when it is opened then fall into the engine compartment when the hood is closed.

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 64,000 model-year 2013-16 Cadillac ATS sedans; this is an expansion of a previous recall of model-year 2013-15 ATS sedans for the same problem. The 2016 model year has been added to the new recall, and 70 percent of the vehicles previously recalled are being recalled again, GM reported.

The Problem: The ATS' power roof panel system will automatically close when the nonrecessed portion of the ""slide"" or ""tilt"" switch is pressed and the roof panel is open; because these switches are not fully recessed, they can be activated with less force than required by federal rules. A stop-sale has also been ordered on unsold vehicles, the automaker said. GM is unaware of any crashes, injuries or fatalities related to this issue.

The Fix: Dealers will replace the roof console accessory switch trim plate for free.

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 284,000 model-year 2011-15 Dodge Charger sedans manufactured between May 6, 2010, and June 5, 2014

The Problem: The side impact sensor calibrations may be overly sensitive; if the sedan's doors are kicked or slammed with excessive force, the side curtain airbags may unexpectedly deploy, and the seat belt pretensioners may activate. This increases the risk of a crash or injury. The automaker on July 25 announced that it was recalling more than 667,000 pickup trucks for the same problem.

	Fiat Chrysler Automobiles issued a voluntary recall today that addresses concerns over remote hacking of some of its vehicles. The company says the network itself has been repaired as of July 23, so the specific hack can't occur.

	It's been a tumultuous week for Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Just days after the automaker recalled 1.4 million cars over a hacking threat, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced FCA will have to pay civil penalties of up to $105 million in response to a federal government probe on 23 separate recalls covering more than 11 million cars.

	The automaker will also have to buy back thousands of FCA vehicles with defective suspension parts as part of the fine, as well as give owners of ""more than a million"" fire-prone Jeeps above-market-value trade-ins or some sort of financial incentive to get their car repaired, according to a NHTSA statement. We're still sifting through NHTSA's order and will have more details later today.

	NHTSA's consent order requires FCA to conduct three separate programs, the most significant of which has the company buying back tens of thousands of trucks and SUVs from owners. None of the programs will apply to owners who already got their cars fixed for a fuel system recall on the Jeeps or a suspension or steering system recall on the others.

	On Aug. 31, FCA released more specifics of the programs. We've updated this story to reflect them.

	FCA will offer a $100 Visa prepaid card if you did not have your recall completed before July 24, 2015, for the following cars:

	You can usually find the build date by month on a sticker around the driver's doorjamb.

	All the vehicles listed above except the Liberty are eligible for a trade-in bonus. FCA will offer an extra $2,000 over market value for Ram pickups and $1,000 over market value for the others, which must be used toward the purchase of another FCA vehicle or toward parts or service.

	The trade-in program is in addition to any existing incentives, which should still be applied to the new car¨¹s final price.

	No. FCA says the trade-in bonus is only available if you purchase a new car.

	The buyback program applies to the cars with the $100 repair incentive (that is, the full list in the second question) minus the Liberty and Grand Cherokee.

	According to NHTSA, the buyback program requires FCA to give a refund of the purchase price minus depreciation plus an additional 10 percent. The automaker says that beginning Sept. 1, 2015, you can see an estimated value of your vehicle on FCArecall.com that assumes ""good"" market condition plus 10 percent.

	Not unless they were on the car when it was new, and you can prove that to FCA. Any modifications made after the vehicle's retail sale won't be calculated into the purchase price, according to NHTSA.

	FCA says you can do that beginning Oct. 1, 2015. If you have a qualified vehicle that hasn¨¹t had its recall repaired, dealers will arrange for a third-party inspector ¨¹ not the dealer's trade-in department ¨¹ to evaluate your car and give you repurchase and trade-in offers. At that point, you can still choose to have the recall repair made to get the $100 gift card.

	FCA says if your car is in fair or poor condition, expect it to get less money than FCA's initial website compensation figures. However, it is still eligible for the bonuses. The third-party inspector will determine the amount for your car.

	No. If you get the recall repair and take the $100 gift card, you can¨¹t also get the trade-in bonus or repurchase offer. You could always trade in your vehicle anyway, but it wouldn't be eligible for the bonus program.

	Some will. FCA ""may remedy and resell any vehicle repurchased"" under the buyback program, according to NHTSA's consent order. The automaker intends to do that for the vehicles it will buy back, FCA spokesman Eric Mayne said. But it won't do so for the cars that got the trade-in bonus because ""they are, many of them, over 20 years old,"" he said. ""It doesn't make economic sense to do that.""

	That's unclear, as it's ""subject to regulation,"" Mayne said. But NHTSA's order requires FCA to ""develop and implement a process to deter dealer sales of unremedied vehicles subject to recall."" That process must include dealer training and financial penalties from FCA.

	The trade-in program ends Jan. 4, 2016. As of Aug. 31, 2015, FCA said the $100 gift card and buyback programs had no expiration date.

	Ford has issued a stop-sale order on model-year 2015 Ford Edge SUVs manufactured before April 28, 2015, due to a possible water-leakage problem, a spokeswoman for the automaker confirmed. About 19,000 of the potentially affected vehicles have already been sold to customers.

	""Our dealers have been notified that in some 2015 Ford Edge models there is the possibility of water entering the cabin,"" Ford stated in an email to Cars.com. ""A customer service action has been put into place to address the situation, which is an issue in certain vehicles built prior to April 28. Owners of affected vehicles have been notified.""

	The water leakage could occur through a joint in the A-pillar and enter the vehicle cabin, Ford stated. In addition to fixing the problem in vehicles already in the hands of owners, dealers will repair unsold vehicles before sale. Vehicles manufactured after April 28 are not affected.

	The stop sale comes hot on the heels of a sales surge for the 2015 Edge. The redesigned SUV saw a 30 percent spike in sales in June compared with June 2014. The Edge sold 12,587 units, with dealers turning them over in just 15 days on average, Ford reported earlier this month.

The Problem: The vehicles are equipped with a dual-stage driver frontal airbag that may be susceptible to moisture intrusion and other factors, including manufacturing variability that over time could cause the inflator to rupture. In a crash necessitating deployment of the driver-side frontal airbag, the inflator could rupture, causing metal fragments to strike the driver or other occupants and resulting in serious injury or death. The recall is part of the massive ongoing Takata airbag issue. Mazda initially announced this recall on June 8.

The Fix: Dealers will replace the driver-side frontal airbag for free. The automaker noted that the remedy for this recall is not yet available. In the meantime, dealers will install a new production airbag inflator under a previous recall of the affected vehicles; this interim remedy inflator will be of the same specification as the original inflator to reduce the amount of time the inflator has been exposed to humidity, but it does not eliminate the long-term potential for rupture and is strictly a stop-gap measure until the newly designed inflators can be produced. Mazda advises these owners to have their vehicles serviced as soon as possible, then serviced again when the new inflators are available under this later recall.

What Owners Should Do: The automaker has not yet announced a notification schedule. Owners can call Mazda at 800-222-5500, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's vehicle-safety hotline at 888-327-4236 or go to www.safercar.gov for more information.

The Problem: Corrosion inside the antilock brake unit may cause one or more of the internal valves to seize. During a braking event that activates the ABS, a seized valve would increase brake pedal travel and reduce braking ability, increasing the risk of a crash.

	How many won't need replacements? Citing sources at Takata and NHTSA, Reuters says another 500,000 replacement inflators actually came from rival suppliers. These inflators use a different chemical propellant than ammonium nitrate, which investigators say is susceptible to moisture. Those 500,000 are good to go, sources told Reuters.

	Of course, that leaves a big question mark on the remaining 3.1 million shipped inflators. No one seems to know their status, Reuters reports. Millions more inflators are due, given NHTSA expanded Takata recalls to 33.8 million driver and front-passenger inflators on May 19; at least seven of the 11 affected automaker have announced recall expansions since then.

	The list of vehicles affected by the Takata airbag recall continues to grow. Mazda announced an expansion of the number of Mazda6 cars affected and added a new vehicle to the list: the B-Series pickup truck, formerly under a regional campaign. It's not surprising since the B-Series is related to the Ford Ranger, which is already under recall. At issue in the B-Series are faulty passenger-side airbag inflators that could rupture, leading to injuries and even death.

	According to Mazda, the B-Series recall expansion affects approximately 12,500 model-year 2004-06 trucks.

	Previously, the 2004-2008 Mazda6 and RX-8 were under national recall for faulty driver-side airbags; the expansion now includes model-year 2003 Mazda6 vehicles. Model-year 2006-2007 Mazdaspeed6 cars manufactured between Aug. 4, 2005, and June 29, 2007, are also being recalled for faulty driver-side airbags. There are no build-date boundaries for the affected model years of the RX-8 and non-Mazdaspeed Mazda6.

The Problem: The affected vehicles were inadvertently equipped with software that may misread torque levels and mistakenly cause a shift into neutral. This condition may occur only when the cruise control is engaged and the driver attempts to override the feature with accelerator-pedal applications or rapid tapping of the accelerate/decelerate buttons. Restarting the vehicle restores normal function. Fiat Chrysler America is unaware of any related injuries, accidents or complaints.

The Fix: FCA began sending service instructions to dealers today, but the automaker has not yet provided an owner notification schedule. Dealers will update the software for free.

What Owners Should Do: Owners can call FCA at 800-853-1403 for more information.

It looks to explain the crisis of defective airbags that can send metal shrapnel into the car as they deploy. Investigators have linked Takata inflators to at least six deaths and more than 100 injuries worldwide.

	Effectively, Toyota took regional recalls in areas of high absolute humidity on five cars and expanded them to nationwide campaigns. Those vehicles are the 2005-2007 Corolla, 2005-2007 Matrix, 2005-2006 Tundra, 2004-2007 Sequoia and 2005-2007 Lexus SC (Lexus is Toyota's luxury division). All five cars are under recall for the passenger-side airbag.

	Earlier model years for all five cars were already under a national recall for the passenger-side airbag. The 2004-2005 RAV4 is the only Toyota under recall for the driver-side airbag; it's also a national campaign.

	Like with several other automakers, Toyota's recall is vehicle specific, and ""not every single vehicle of the model year"" listed will actually be recalled, spokeswoman Cindy Knight told us. But those instances should be rare, given that Toyota says the grand total for Takata recalls in the U.S. (that is, the 2003-2007 Corolla and Matrix, 2003-2006 Tundra, 2002-2007 Sequoia, 2004-2005 RAV4 and 2002-2007 Lexus SC) amounts to 2.92 million cars. A Cars.com analysis of Automotive News sales data for those cars during their respective calendar years suggests that the vast majority of recalled cars will, in fact, be recalled.

	Toyota determines recall inclusion by vehicle identification number and will notify affected owners by first-class mail.

	That adds some confusion on a car-by-car basis, but at least one other complication has been removed: geography. There are no more regional Takata recalls for Toyota, though owners in certain areas of high humidity will still receive regional notices instead of national ones. The repair calls for dealers to replace the affected airbag inflator, and Knight said it's the same regardless of where you live or which notice you get. Owners will get only one notice, not both, she added.

	This week's expansion brings Toyota's U.S. recall total for Takata airbags to 2.92 million cars. Replacement inflators remain ""limited,"" Toyota says, and the automaker is prioritizing replacement in areas of high absolute humidity, given Takata's lab tests suggest humidity plays a major role in the inflator malfunctions. However, Toyota still advises owners with unrepaired passenger-side airbag recalls to keep the seat free of occupants until the repair is made, regardless of where they live.

	GM is also expanding its recall of the Pontiac Vibe, a corporate twin to the Matrix, to include what appears to be a national recall for the 2003-2007 model years. Previously there was only a regional recall on the 2003-2004 Vibe. GM spokesman Alan Adler told us the recall total for the Vibe now stands at 342,000, though it's still unclear if Toyota's total (2.92 million) includes that figure.

	Toyota is the 10th ¨¹ and last ¨¹ major automaker to address NHTSA's May 19 announcement. Eight of the other nine major automakers involved in U.S. Takata airbag recalls have announced expansions since the announcement. The ninth, Nissan, told NHTSA on May 29 that the expansion does not affect it.

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 160,000 model-year 2004-05 Toyota RAV4 compact SUVs manufactured between May 13, 2003, and Oct. 25, 2005

The Problem: In the recalled vehicles, the driver-side dual-stage frontal airbag may be susceptible to moisture intrusion, which could cause the inflator to rupture or the airbag to deploy unexpectedly. In a crash where the frontal airbag deploys, the airbag inflator could rupture with metal fragments potentially injuring the driver or passengers. 

The Fix: Dealers will replace the driver's frontal airbag for free.

	It's a reversal of course for the agency. NHTSA spokesman Gordon Trowbridge told us in April that ""based on testing and field data, NHTSA does not currently see a need to expand the recalls"" for passenger-side inflators beyond humid regions.

	One caveat: The Detroit News says Takata may trim the recall total later if it determines that not all passenger airbags require a national campaign.

	Takata is replacing the inflators, and NHTSA said today that its analyses point toward prolonged moisture affecting the chemical propellant in the airbag inflators. However, ""testing and investigation by Takata, auto manufacturers, and independent researchers have not yet established a definitive root cause of the inflator malfunctions,"" the agency said.

	NHTSA says it's issued a ""consent order"" to Takata, which ""requires the company to cooperate in all future regulatory actions that NHTSA undertakes in its ongoing investigation and oversight of Takata."" The agency has been pressing Takata since November 2014 to declare millions more cars defective, according to The Detroit News.

Owners who already received repairs will need to get new replacement airbags again, BMW says. The automaker also added model-year 2002-2003 5 Series and model-year 2003-2004 X5s, both with optional sport steering wheels. If your car has the normal steering wheel, it isn't under recall.

	This week saw a flurry of updates after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration prompted an expansion of Takata's airbag campaign to nearly 34 million recalls. Ford has the largest update so far, nearly tripling its prior total to 1.51 million cars and adding the most-recent car in the crisis so far: the 2014 Mustang.

	Previously, the most recent car involved was the 2011 Honda Element. Ford has gone well beyond that: In response to last week's Takata notifications, the automaker expanded its recall tally to include the 2005-2014 Mustang and 2005-2006 GT exotic, plus the 2004-2006 Ford Ranger pickup built at two specific assembly plants. That's a major revision from before, when a slew of build dates and geographies factored in ¨¹ and the Mustang was only under recall for the 2005-2008 model years.

	In total, Ford's recall count is up about 966,000 cars from before, spokeswoman Kelli Felker told Cars.com.

	""There's no geographic boundaries, but there are also no build date boundaries,"" Felker said. ""This includes every one of those vehicles in those models regardless of where they're built in the world.""

	Ford owners will receive notices beginning the week of July 13, she added. Mustang and GT recalls involve the driver's-side airbag, while the Ranger's recall involves the front-passenger airbag.

	Separately, Mitsubishi expanded its Takata recall for the Lancer compact to include some 2006 models. It's also for the passenger-side airbag.
"

	For GM and Subaru, it's a bit of both. GM is adding two heavy-duty trucks: the 2007-2008 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD and 3500HD built from Nov. 28, 2006, to Aug. 29, 2008, and the 2007-2008 GMC Sierra 2500HD and 3500HD built from Nov. 27, 2006, to Aug. 29, 2008. The national recall, which encompasses 330,198 trucks, affects the front-passenger airbag. Neither truck was under a Takata airbag recall until now.

	Subaru's latest expansion affects a smaller pool of cars (81,100), and it confirms what the automaker told us nearly two weeks ago. On May 20, spokesman Michael McHale said that because of NHTSA's expansion, an earlier regional recall on the Impreza would become national.

	NHTSA confirmed it on May 28. All model-year 2004-2005 Impreza sedans and hatchbacks built from Jan. 28, 2003, to May 31, 2005, are under recall. So is the 2005 Saab 9-2X, which is based on the Impreza hatchback; only models built from Feb. 11, 2004, to March 17, 2005, are affected. Both cars are under national recall for the front-passenger airbag. GM, which owned the now-defunct Saab until 2010, will service 9-2X recalls.

	If you own an affected vehicle, you can typically find the build date (by month, anyhow) on a sticker in the driver's doorjamb. Subaru's latest announcement ""partially supersedes"" an earlier campaign that also included regional recalls on the 2003-2005 Baja, Legacy and Outback, according to NHTSA. Those recalls are still in place, McHale told us today.

Only the following vehicles are affected: Ford Flex and Lincoln MKT vehicles built at the Oakville Assembly Plant from Sept. 7, 2010, to Feb. 28, 2012; Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ vehicles built at the Hermosillo Assembly Plant from Sept. 7, 2010, to Feb. 28, 2012; Mercury Milan vehicles built at the Hermosillo Assembly Plant from Sept. 7, 2010, to Dec. 10, 2010; and Ford Taurus and Lincoln MKS vehicles built at the Chicago Assembly Plant from Sept. 7, 2010, to Feb. 28, 2012.

The Problem: An electrical steering connection problem could cause the loss of electric power steering assist while driving. If this happens, the steering system defaults to manual steering mode, which makes the vehicle more difficult to steer and increases the risk of an accident. Ford said it is aware of four minor accidents that might be related to this condition, but no injuries.

Assessing totals is murky science at best, given the numbers are often amended later and recalls are sometimes expanded. We searched the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's records for every recall issued in 2014, with the caveat that some numbers could change. Not surprisingly, the two biggest recall headlines ¨¹ ignitions and airbags ¨¹ accounted for plenty of the top 10.
How many:
 5.88 million cars 

Date:
 July 3 

What happened:
 Though often associated with 2.2 million 

small
 cars (namely the Chevrolet Cobalt) that GM recalled for faulty ignitions, the General's largest campaign in 2014 was for a swath of midsize and full-size cars from the late 1990s and 2000s. Like the Cobalt fiasco, these larger cars could inadvertently allow the key to rotate out of the ""On"" position while driving over a bump or other road disruption, particularly if a heavy keychain was pulling the key in a counterclockwise direction. But unlike in the small-car recall, GM said its larger cars needed only a retrofitted key ring hole to prevent the attachment of such keychains. 

The vehicle totals reflect cars in the U.S., not global vehicles or vehicles the automaker has identified as still in circulation. And the numbers are often adjusted upward or downward for a litany or reasons, like regional expansions or amended double counting.
Case in point: GM's July 3 recall was originally for 6.81 million vehicles, not 5.88 million. The automaker later revised the figure downward ""because double counting was done of about 1 million vehicles,"" spokesman Alan Adler told us.

Airbags can inadvertently deploy in 2.12 million Acura, Dodge, Jeep, Honda, Pontiac and Toyota vehicles, increasing the risk of an injury.
NHTSA says this campaign will provide owners with a new remedy after the manufacturers' original attempts to fix the defects proved ineffective.
Approximately 374,200 Honda vehicles are affected:
Approximately 753,200 vehicles from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are affected:
Approximately 1.2 million Toyota vehicles are affected:
NHTSA says that in these vehicles, an airbag control module component made by supplier TRW could fail, causing the front airbags, side airbags, and/or seat belt pretensioners to suddenly deploy while the vehicle is being driven. Many of these vehicles have already been fixed under a previous campaign, but NHTSA says it's identified about 40 vehicles in which airbags deployed unexpectedly after receiving the original remedy.
Dealers will replace the airbag control module and front- and/or side-impact sensors for free, but the parts aren't currently available. In the meantime, dealers will perform an interim repair. NHTSA says the repair reduces the risk of an inadvertent deployment; the parts for the permanent fix will not be available until late 2015.
""This is unfortunately a complicated issue for consumers, who may have to return to their dealer more than once. But this is an urgent safety issue, and all consumers with vehicles covered by the previous recalls should have that remedy installed. Even though it's a temporary solution until the new remedy is available, they and their families will be safer if they take the time to learn if their vehicle is covered and follow their manufacturers' instructions. A hassle is much better than a family tragedy,"" NHTSA Administrator Mark Rosekind said in a statement.
Consumers with questions can call NHTSA's Safety Hotline at 888-327-4236; Chrysler,800-853-1403; Toyota, 800-331-4331; or Honda, 800-999-1009.

54,https://www.cars.com/articles/2015/01/recall-prompts-move-of-lincoln-mkcs-start-button/,Recall Prompts Move of Lincoln MKC's Start Button,"According to Ford, the push-button start module is too close to other controls, and drivers could inadvertently bump the button and shut off the engine while driving. If this happens, the restraint systems may not function, increasing the risk of an injury during a crash.
The recall affects 11,144 versions of model-year 2015 MKCs in the U.S. built between Aug. 20, 2013, and Sept. 9, 2014, at Ford's Louisville Assembly Plant in Kentucky, and the fix sounds extreme: completely relocate the MKC's push-button start control panel.
Kelli Felker, Ford's safety communications manager, told Cars.com that the push-button keyless ignition switch, which was originally located at the bottom of the gear shift module (pictured above), will be moved to the top of that panel. Dealers will perform the move and reprogram the powertrain control module for free. Felker says owners can expect the repair to take ""less than one half day, depending upon dealer service scheduling availability.""
Ford said there have been no accidents or injuries related to this issue, but an increase in field reports led to the recall. ""While any button can be activated inadvertently, our monitoring of field data showed the original design position had an increasing number of reports,"" Felker said.

54,https://www.cars.com/articles/2015/01/government-fines-honda-70-million/,U.S. Government Fines Honda $70 Million,"In November, Honda disclosed that it failed to report safety problems in a timely manner, specifically underreporting how many people died or were injured by faulty Takata airbag inflators in its vehicles.  Now it's time to pay the consequences. The U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that Honda will pay two $35 million civil penalties, for a total of $70 million.
According to NHTSA, the first fine is for the automaker's failure to report 1,729 death and injury claims between 2003 and 2014. The second penalty stems from Honda's failure to report certain warranty claims and claims under customer satisfaction campaigns throughout the same time period. Both infractions violate the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability, and Documentation Act.
It's the largest auto safety fine in U.S. history and dwarfs the fine levied against General Motors last year; GM paid $35 million for its missteps in handling ignition-related recalls. Like GM, Honda also agreed to increased NHTSA oversight and third-party audits to ensure the law is followed in the future.
The agency imposed $126 million in fines in 2014, which is more than it issued in total in the agency's 40-plus-year history, according to NHTSA. The government plans to keep the heat on automakers to ensure safety accountably in the future. 
""Honda and all of the automakers have a safety responsibility they must live up to ¨¹ no excuses. Last year alone, we issued more fines than in NHTSA's entire history. These fines reflect the tough stance we will take against those who violate the law and fail to do their part in the mission to keep Americans safe on the road,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx said in a statement.
Honda agrees and the automaker says it has already begun taking steps to correct the errors that led to the violations, including initiating new training regimens, changing internal reporting policy, making staffing and organizational changes, and enhancing oversight of its early warning reporting process.
""We have resolved this matter and will move forward to build on the important actions Honda has already taken to address our past shortcomings in early warning reporting. We continue to fully cooperate with NHTSA to achieve greater transparency and to further enhance our reporting practices,"" Rick Schostek, Honda North America executive vice president, said in a statement.

BMW and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles announced major expansions to their campaigns, which affect cars with faulty airbag inflators that could rupture when they deploy and send shrapnel into occupants. Inflators have been reportedly linked to at least five deaths and dozens of injuries, but Takata maintains that the problem only occurs in high-humidity areas.
FCA calls the latest move a ""field action,"" not a recall, ""because only defects compel recalls, and there is no established defect,"" spokesman Eric Mayne told Cars.com, though owners would receive something ""identical to recall communication."" The automaker insisted in its statement that neither itself nor Takata has identified a defect in this particular population of inflators, which are distinct from the inflators linked to the five fatalities. More than 1,000 tests have been performed on these components without incident, FCA says, but one Florida injury in ""an older-model sedan"" has been linked.

The affected airbags can launch shrapnel into passengers as they deploy; incidents were observed in high-humidity areas, prompting 10 automakers to recall scores of 2000s-era models registered in states such as Florida. The total previously stood at nearly 8 million cars, but that figure is rising fast.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration blasted FCA in an emailed statement. ""Chrysler's latest recall is insufficient, doesn't meet our demands and fails to include all inflators covered by Takata's defect information report,"" the agency said.
Regulators disagree. NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman has reportedly threatened serious fines against the company, which could total $7,000 per vehicle ¨¹ more than $75 billion, at minimum. But the agency needs to go through a series of actions, including public and court hearings, to force it. It's begun to take such steps, Friedman said to Congress.

But it¨¹s an inconvenient procedure, as depicted above in the owner's manual for a 2008 Chevrolet Cobalt. GM's fix? Replace the console-mounted automatic transmission shifter, which can fail to send an electrical signal to the ignition when the car is put in Park. That signal allows you to rotate the key from the Run position into the Lock position and remove it, the automaker said in an emailed statement.
The problem only occurs in ""3 to 4 percent of the vehicles,"" Adler said, but GM is sending letters to owners of all 2.2 million cars in the original recall. That figure comes from 2.59 million cars worldwide ¨¹ the vast majority in the U.S. and Canada ¨¹ under the ignition-switch recall, minus cars with manual transmissions, which don't have the problem, and cars that have been scrapped. If owners experience the sticking key, they can bring their vehicles into any GM dealer (Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet or GMC) and get the transmission shifter replaced for free.
Affected models include the 2005-10 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2006-11 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-10 Pontiac Solstice, 2007-10 Pontiac G5, 2005-06 Pontiac G4 (Pursuit in Canada), 2007-10 Saturn Sky and 2003-07 Saturn Ion, according to GM¨¹s statement. The automaker will also extend the vehicle warranty for keys that get stuck to 15 years after their original service date.
""GM knows of no crashes, injuries or fatalities related to the issue,"" the statement said. ""Only customers who experience the sticking keys issue should contact a dealer.""
GM decided to issue the letters after reviewing some 40 complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Adler said.
""We're seeing this issue both before the cars are fixed [for the ignition recall] and after,"" he said. ¨¹The investigation said, well, it's not the ignition cylinder and it's not the ignition switch.¨¹
At worst, the situation will result in a dead battery.
""It's not a safety issue,"" Adler said. ""You've parked the vehicle. Now you can't get the key out.""

Honda is the only automaker to publically extend its campaign across all 50 states; others have recalled cars mostly in the Gulf Coast, Hawaii and various U.S. territories. Honda's national recall will reportedly phase in over several months, with the initial focus on high-humidity areas.

According to The Detroit News, Deputy NHTSA Administrator David Friedman was preparing to tell a U.S. Senate committee that the agency doesn't have sufficient data to force a nationwide recall, and that such a broad action could divert limited replacement parts from targeted high-humidity regions of the country where affected cars are already known to be high-risk. Friedman's written testimony mirrored language used by Takata early this week in opposing a national recall.

"
58,https://www.cars.com/articles/2014/11/survey-recalls-influence-car-shoppers-/,Survey: Recalls Influence Car Shoppers,"Meanwhile, new-car sales at GM are up 3.9 percent through October. That falls short of the industry's 5.5 percent gain, according to Automotive News, but it's better than you'd expect for an automaker whose 25.6 million recalls top other automakers by a mile. Other recall-heavy automakers have had mixed years: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is up 15.8 percent and Toyota is up 5.8 percent, but Ford and Honda are roughly flat.
Still, a new survey suggests that car shoppers do, in fact, care about recalls ¨¹ and most of them know about this year's largest ones. How that influences shoppers' decisions, on the other hand, is up for debate.
The survey, which Rhinebeck, N.Y.-based Phoenix Marketing International released Oct. 28, found that more than 60 percent of people in the market for a new car are aware of specific recalls over the past two months. GM as a whole came highest in terms of unaided awareness, at ""well over 50 percent,"" Dennis Syrkowski, president of PMI's automotive practice, told us. Toyota came in around 30 percent, and Ford was at 20 percent. Other brands fell below 10 percent.
""We didn't probe on a specific recall ¨¹ in other words, 'Do you recall the GM ignition switch recall,' "" Syrkowski said. Instead, PMI asked which brands consumers remember being in a recent recall. And the answers aligned with recent events.
In turn, about half of shoppers said they were less likely to consider a new Chevrolet, GM's mainstream brand. A third of shoppers cited recent recalls as a reason to cross Toyota off their lists, and a quarter said the same of Ford.
""The negative halo due to the recalls was pretty enormous for brands like GM ¨¹ Chevrolet, GMC, basically all the GM brands,"" Syrkowski said. ""Recalls tend to be so topical and very much in the moment in terms of, is it affecting consumers' shopping habits right now. When we look at it over time, that's when we see a kind of a trend emerging.""
""You're already going to have a group of people who won't consider General Motors product anyway,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions. But in a survey, they'll say, ""of course I'm not going to buy one because of that recall.""
AutoPacific analyst Ed Kim agreed.
""Even though GM is a market-share leader in the U.S., there's still a huge chunk of people out there who don't want a GM car for a variety of reasons,"" Kim told us. ""I suspect a lot of people who indicated that [they wouldn't consider a GM] are non-GM considerers in the first place.""
PMI's Syrkowski said he doesn't have a ""clean way to isolate the impact of the recalls,"" but the company has surveyed for brand consideration before the current spate of campaigns.""Among those aware of the recalls, there was a 5 to 10 percent hit to consideration for the brands mentioned most often as having recalls, such as Chevrolet,"" Syrkowski said.
Fiorani thinks ""the needle has to move"" in consumer perceptions after the airbag recall. Like GM's ignition-switch recall, which affects a lot of older small cars, the Takata airbags are mostly in older, 2000s-era cars ¨¹ the sort that belong to people who aren't necessarily in the market for a new vehicle.
There's some historical precedent for incentives if recalls cost an automaker in sales. During the 14 months from September 2009 through the end of 2010 ¨¹ a period during which Toyota recalled some 12 million cars because of unintended acceleration and even stopped the sale of certain models for short periods ¨¹ the automaker's share of new-car sales fell to 15.8 percent. Before the crisis, from January through August 2009, it was 16.5 percent.
But Fiorani said he doesn't see any tie between today's incentives and 2014's record recalls.
""I don't think it's so much [because of] recalls at this point,"" he said. ""I think we're just seeing the plants ¨¹ trying to keep the plants running at peak capacity. I don't think there's a slide [toward incentives] yet based on recalls alone.""
Still, that could change as automakers push to gain market share, particularly if the latest Takata airbag recall ""hits enough people and they get scared,"" he added. Then, incentives could come from the unlikeliest of places: the competition.

Still, it could take several months before the agency could force automakers to recall more cars through its full statutory powers, according to the Detroit News.
The agency also ordered automakers to submit documents that show what they¨¹ve done to test the airbag inflators outside of high-humidity areas.

The affected seats were manufactured between December 2011 and May 2013.
The Problem: The seat's harness buckle could become difficult to unlatch due to prolonged exposure to food and drink spills. If the buckle becomes stuck, it could be challenging to quickly remove the child from the seat in the event of a crash or other emergency. ""None of the complaints Evenflo has received involved a child injury or an emergency exit from the vehicle,"" the manufacturer said in a statement.
The Fix: Evenflo will notify registered owners and send a newly designed buckle and instructions for installing the replacement buckle. Click here for a tutorial on how to clean your buckle. If your car seat is not registered, register it here.
What Owners Should Do: Evenflo began notifying owners earlier this week. Owners can contact Evenflo at 800-490-7591, or visit their website.

Today, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that it will formally review millions more Chrysler SUVs, pickup trucks and minivans starting with the 2007 model year due to complaints of problems associated with the same module. An Aug. 21 letter from advocacy group the Center for Auto Safety initiated the review, informing NHTSA of 63 complaints pertaining to problems allegedly caused by the module.
Recall Alert: 2011 Dodge Durango, Jeep Grand Cherokee
""The CAS alleges that TIPM failures have resulted in incidents of engine stall; airbag non-deployment; random horn, headlight, taillight, door lock, instrument panel and windshield wiper activity; failure of fuel pump shutoff resulting in unintended acceleration; and fires,"" NHTSA said in a statement, also noting that the CAS petition also references a class-action lawsuit that has been filed regarding the alleged module failure.
NHTSA said a preliminary analysis of the complaints identified 51 reports alleging 17 engine stalls and 34 no-start incidents; there also were three reports of smoke or fire. None of the complaints alleged airbag failures or unintended acceleration, nor any crashes. However, CAS identified two dozen crashes from a NHTSA accident database that it believes may be related to TIPM failure.
Of the 63 complaints being considered in the review, 36 involve model-year 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango SUVs equipped with 3.6- or 5.7-liter engines, the same models recalled earlier this month. Other vehicles associated with the NHTSA review include:

The report also concludes that the agency failed to link three investigations on crashes involving airbags that didn't deploy in the Chevrolet Cobalt and didn't understand ""vehicle systems and functions implemented in response to the agency's own standards,"" including the link between airbags and vehicle power.
NHTSA Deputy Administrator David Friedman defended the agency to The Detroit News on Monday, saying he'd met with a dozen automakers to facilitate further discussions on how vehicle systems interact. NHTSA's actions have also prompted some 1,300 recalls over the past decade.

NHTSA is allowed to make what's called a ""death inquiry,"" which asks automakers to provide the cause of a given accident. But the answer is optional, and the vast majority of automakers decline to provide it. Prior to the publication of the article, NHTSA reversed its policy and now requires those answers.

Vehicles Affected: More than 130,000 model-year 2013-14 Ford Focus ST hatchbacks equipped with 2.0-liter engines and manufactured at the Michigan Assembly Plant between Feb. 14, 2012, and Oct. 14, 2013, and Escape crossovers equipped with 2.0-liter engines and manufactured at the Louisville Assembly Plant between Oct. 5, 2011, and April 1, 2013, according to The Detroit News
The Problem: Wiring harnesses may have splices that were insufficiently compressed by the supplier, The Detroit News reported. Poor electrical connections can cause erroneous signals to be sent to the powertrain control module and affect engine performance. The defect may result in an engine malfunction indicator light illuminating, reduced engine power, hesitation or stalling, the newspaper reported. No crashes or injuries related to the condition have been reported. This is the 11th recall involving the 2013 Escape.
The Fix: Ford will notify owners, and dealers will replace the affected wiring splices for free.
What Owners Should Do: Owners can call Ford at 866-436-7332 for more info.

""Six percent is not really high at all, in terms of unreachable [owners],"" GM spokesman Alan Adler told us. ""We couldn't find owners for them at the end of the quarter. I'm sure the number's much lower now. That's all June 30 numbers.""
""We'll continue to go after folks to find them,"" Adler said. ""We have a number of things that we'll be putting into place.""
GM plans to have enough parts to fix all ignition-recalled cars by October. As of right now, Adler said, the automaker's dealers have fixed about 700,000 cars at a rate of 10,000 to 16,000 per day.
""A lot of people have ordered parts but haven't come in for the repair yet,"" he added. ""Right now we have more parts than we do demand. We've actually crossed that line.""
The automaker says its recall completion rate is 80 percent ¨¹ slightly better than the industry's 75 percent average ¨¹ within a year of sending out notices. But undeliverable notices for GM vary from zero to 2 percent or higher depending on the recall, according to The Detroit News.

Vehicles Affected: 202,115 Saturn Vue SUVs from the 2002 to 2004 model years in the U.S., with around 13,000 more outside the country.
The Problem: Two potential issues exist. The first is that if you stop the vehicle and put the automatic transmission in Park, you could have a hard time getting the key out. ""The ignition cylinder can bind, and the key can get stuck in there,"" GM spokesman Alan Adler told us. The second possibility is an opposite problem: The key may be removable when the car is stopped but not in Park. Although this is an ignition-related issue, Adler said that there is no danger of what GM has termed ""unintended key rotation"" ¨¹ i.e., the key getting bumped out of the Run position while the car is moving, which is responsible for more than 10 million GM recalls this year. ""It's not an ignition switch"" problem, Adler maintained. ""That is not the issue here."" That said, GM said in a press release that it's aware of two crashes and one injury ""potentially related"" to the Vue's issue.
The Fix: GM dealers will inspect the key for either problem. If it exists, dealers will replace the ignition cylinder and keys for free.
What Owners Should Do: Owners can call Saturn customer assistance at 800-553-6000. Adler says he doesn't have a timeline yet on how long it will take for replacement parts to show up, but GM recommends that owners ensure their vehicles are in Park before exiting; stick-shift SUVs (yes, Saturn did sell a few) should be put into Reverse and the parking brake should be set.

The website looked at listed prices for the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt, 2007 Pontiac G5, 2003-2007 Saturn Ion, 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR, 2006-2007 Saturn Sky and 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice. All six models were among the 2.2 million cars recalled in the U.S. between Feb. 25 and April 9 for faulty ignition switches and then, ultimately, faulty ignition cylinders.
From March to June 2014, the average price for the group fell 14 percent versus the same inflation-adjusted period a year ago, iSeeCars.com says, with the largest year-over-year drop occurring in June. Non-luxury 2005-2007 models in general, meanwhile, dropped just 6.7 percent over the same four-month period in 2014 versus 2013. The Cobalt, G5 and Ion suffered the most, while the HHR, Sky and Solstice saw comparatively lighter falls.
ISeeCars notes the following trends:
""If overall the average price change is about twice the average of the similar [non-luxury] cars, that's saying, OK, the recall had some effect overall,"" iSeeCars CEO Phong Ly told us.
The study did not analyze used-car prices for some 11 million cars GM recalled in June to address unintended key rotation. (Although those recalls were also ignition-related, the automaker's fix called for retrofitting keys and sometimes key fobs but not replacing ignition switches or cylinders, as the Cobalt et al. required.)
If a seller says the recall work has been done, demand evidence, like an itemized receipt from a GM dealership's service department. GM recommends taking the car's vehicle identification number, which you can find at the base of the driver's-side windshield or along the doorjamb, and giving it to a GM dealer or the automaker's customer-care center. Both groups can run the VIN to see if the recall work has been done.
That said, you should have little problem finding candidates. Overall supply of GM cars fell 1 percent, Ly notes, but Cars.com inventory still shows more than 6,500 used Chevrolet Cobalts alone, with a median listed price right around $8,000.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration receives more than 40,000 consumer complaints each year ¨¹ and looks into all of them, said Kathryn Henry, media relations for the U.S. Department of Transportation and NHTSA.
""Vehicle safety is a top priority for the department and over the past seven years, NHTSA safety defect investigations resulted in 929 recalls involving more than 55 million vehicles and motor-vehicle equipment, which has helped us reduce vehicle fatalities to historic lows,"" Henry said.
Here's how to file a vehicle safety complaint with NHTSA and how your complaint can become a recall:
Automakers can also initiate a recall before the government gets involved, but consumers stepping up and identifying issues plays a big role in ensuring manufacturers continue to make safe vehicles. You might think your one complaint doesn't stand a chance in a database filled with problems, but as Henry explains, NHTSA continually and carefully monitors new and previously submitted consumer complaints, data and other resources to identify defect trends.
""This is the agency's routine procedure for keeping our eyes and ears open to spot trends that may indicate a safety defect,"" she said.

69,https://www.cars.com/articles/2014/07/chrysler-launches-its-own-ignition-switch-recall-/,Chrysler Launches Its Own Ignition Switch Recall ,"GM has been in the news for most of 2014 due to numerous recalls covering millions of vehicles for faulty ignition switches. Now, another major automaker is launching a recall over similar issues.
Late today, Chrysler announced a recall covering approximately 650,000 Jeeps in the U.S. and nearly 800,000 worldwide for an ignition switch that could fail in a similar fashion to what has been detailed in some of GM's recalled vehicles.
The models covered are the 2006-2007 Jeep Commander and 2005-2007 Jeep Grand Cherokee SUVs.
Chrysler says that the recall is being initiated ""out of an abundance of caution."" The switch could move out of the on position if something hits the key with enough force. This would usually be a knee during a collision. This could lead the engine to stall, but more significantly the airbags would not deploy.
While there are numerous reports of fatalities and injuries regarding the GM recall, Chrysler said in a statement that it is unaware of any injuries due to the recalled switch with one reported accident. Chrysler said complaints have been ""relatively small"" and give a percentage of .015 percent, which would be approximately 9,500 complaints just in the U.S.
Chrysler has not developed a fix for its ignition-switch defect and will start alerting owners in September. Until then the company is recommending owners remove any key rings from the ignition key when in use.

69,https://www.cars.com/articles/2014/07/gm-announces-six-more-recalls/,GM Announces Six More Recalls,"GM announced six new recalls that cover 717,950 Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC models from the 2010 to 2015 model years. The bulk of the recalls ü 414,333 cars ü involves late-model GM midsize SUVs, the Chevrolet Camaro sports cars and two Buick sedans, all with power height-adjustable seats. The power adjusters have faulty bolts, which may cause the seats to move up or down freely; GM says owners should not use the height adjuster until dealers replace the bolts. The automaker says it's aware of one crash and three injuries but no fatalities that stem from the issue.
Another 57,242 Chevrolet Impalas have a new power-steering issue; GM says it's aware of one crash but no injuries or fatalities from it.
The automaker says it's unaware of any crashes related to the remainder of the recalls, which include 124,008 recalls for potentially incomplete seat welding on two Chevrolet sedans, a trio of Cadillac cars, the Buick Encore and the Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra pickups. Another 120,426 Chevrolet Malibu and Buick Regal sedans have faulty turn-signal indicators in the instrument cluster, while 1,919 Chevrolet Sparks have an improperly fastened front-sususpension component. Finally, GM will recall just 22 Chevrolet Tahoe/Suburban and GMC Yukon SUVs with improperly attached roof rails.
This latest batch brings GM's total to 25.5 million recalls in the U.S. thus far in 2014. None of today's recalls involve ignition issues, which are responsible for about 14.4 million GM recalls so far in 2014. Note that those figures don't add up to the prior totals plus today's announcement, as GM told reporters this afternoon that it double-counted certain models in earlier recalls this year, which led to a larger figure than the actual number.
We'll have full details, including model years, on all six recalls as soon as possible.

The recalled models span the 1997 to 2014 model years; most of the cars that exhibit the unintended key rotation are late-'90s and early-2000s midsize and large sedans from Chevrolet and GM's now-discontinued Oldsmobile and Pontiac brands; also in the ignition group are newer Cadillac CTS and SRX models. In total, about 97 percent of today's recalls are ignition-related.

The problem ¨¹ and GM's solution ¨¹ is closer to the automaker's more recent ignition-related recalls: 464,712 Chevrolet Camaros in the U.S. on June 13 and 3.16 million larger cars in the U.S. on June 16. Confused? That's because GM's ignition-related recalls, which are now responsible for more than half the automaker's 2014 U.S. recall total, are three separate, albeit related, categories:
GM says this latest recall stems from the second and third problems.
""It's [the] same sort of outcome, but it's not the same issue"" as the small-car recall, said Alan Adler, the automaker's recall spokesman. ""These are not bad parts.""
In today's Cadillac CTS and SRX recall, ""you've got the knee-bump [issue], which is similar to the Camaro"" recall on June 13, Adler said. ""Bumping is a possibility with the Cadillacs, and that was not the case with the other older vehicles.""
Either way, he said GM will modify or replace the key.
""Depending on the type of key, it's either additional rings ¨¹ two small, 4-by-6 millimeter rings ¨¹ which would separate your key from your [remote] fob, so the fob would hang free,"" he said. ""Or it is an insert to create a hole where the slot was, and you'd add the rings to that.""
GM said in a press release that it's aware of seven crashes, eight injuries and three fatalities related to today's recall, but there isn't conclusive evidence that faulty ignitions were to blame.
""The three fatalities ¨¹ those were all non-airbag-deployment cases,"" Adler said. ""Now, there are lots of reasons that those airbags may not go off.""
GM has ""investigated it thoroughly,"" he added. ""We cannot determine conclusively"" if the airbag non-deployments were caused by ignition defects.

The fix is to the key itself; GM said it will rework the key, adding an insert to it so that large items cannot be attached to the key. ""Rework of the keys ¨¹ adding key inserts ¨¹ at GM dealerships is expected to begin in the next few weeks. Until the rework or replacement is completed, owners of the recalled cars are urged to remove additional weight from their key chains and drive with only the ignition key,"" the automaker said in a statement.

The original recall was announced in April 2013 and covered several Toyota, Honda, Nissan and Mazda vehicles ¨¹ almost 3 million vehicles worldwide and over a million in the U.S. Now Toyota is saying that more of its vehicles are affected. ""Toyota has determined that the involved serial numbers provided by the supplier were incomplete, and did not include all of the potentially involved inflators,"" the automaker said in a statement.
The Toyota models affected by the original recall and the expansion include certain 2003-04 Corolla sedans, Matrix hatchbacks and Tundra pickup trucks; certain 2002-04 Sequoia SUVs; and certain 2002-04 Lexus SC 430 coupes. Toyota says that approximately 766,300 vehicles in the U.S. were covered by the 2013 recall but did not release numbers related to the expansion.
The recall expansion is being combined with a renotification campaign. According to Toyota, owners of vehicles under the original recall that were inspected but did not receive a replacement inflator will get a new letter telling them the inflator will be replaced. Owners with vehicles affected by the expanded recall will get a letter telling them the part will be replaced.
The repairs will be done for free; consumers with questions can call Toyota at 800-331-4331 or Lexus at 800-255-3987.

Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast Solutions, agreed. GM incentives are ""on par with what they normally are with the market,"" Fiorani said. ""They're up a little bit, [but] incentives go up and down a little bit month-to-month, year-to-year.""
""They're vehicles no longer being sold,"" said Chris Hopson, a senior analyst at IHS Automotive. ""Perhaps high-level damage on brand perception might occur on this, but that might not really come out in month-to-month sales results.""
""The big recalls in the '70s were much harsher recalls,"" Fiorani explained. ""Today there are recalls for everything. The recall numbers are large, but there are relatively few that are catastrophic. And the public perception is, ¨¹Oh it's just another recall.' ""
""When you have an issue like this, it's not so much how much [incentive] money's on the table, but the trust in the vehicle,"" Fiorani said. ""Issues like this would probably be covered with a better warranty. When Isuzu and Hyundai and Mitsubishi were all having issues years ago, they all added 10-year warranties. This helps shore up the buyer's belief in the vehicle.""
Any warranty changes would come atop GM's existing provisions, which are competitive given that the automaker pairs them with two years' free maintenance. If GM makes any move, it could be there ¨¹ or something more outside the box, like Hyundai's Assurance program.
In any case, don't expect big new incentives. Fiorani says it would be the wrong move.
""If I get an extra $500 or $1,000 [off], that's not going to necessarily help my confidence in the car, long-term,"" he said. ""It's just going to make it cheaper right now.""

A few other details caught our attention. The DOT says the bill will provide billions of dollars to improve the safety of rural roads and fund highway-safety research and improvements. It also promotes graduated teen driver's licenses and improves drunken driving prevention laws, including ignition interlocks and open-container laws.
About half the funding for the proposed Grow America Act will come through business tax reforms. The bill is now in Congress.

79,https://www.cars.com/articles/2014/04/gm-begins-to-replace-faulty-ignition/,GM Begins to Replace Faulty Ignition Switches,"GM said Wednesday it has shipped ""thousands"" of new ignition sets to dealers for some 2.6 million recalled small cars (2.2 million in the U.S.) from the 2003-2011 model years. Dealerships are conducting the repairs right now, the automaker said.
GM Ignition-Switch Recall: What Owners Need to Know
GM mailed letters last week telling owners of 1.4 million 2003-2007 models to contact a GM dealer ¨¹ that's Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet or GMC ¨¹ and schedule an appointment for the recall work. Owners of more than 800,000 recalled 2008-2011 models will receive letters in early May that confirm their inclusion in the recall, with subsequent letters when those replacement parts become available.
The new ignition set, which includes ignition switches and cylinders plus new keys, can be installed in about 90 minutes at any of the automaker's 4,300 dealer service departments, though wait times could be longer depending on workload. GM spokesman Jim Cain told us customers will receive new ""universal"" keys that work the trunk, doors and ignition. Of course, one issue is just how many owners will comply.
Part of the problem is awareness. CNW Marketing Research notes that in the 1970s, more than half of all consumers were aware of specific major auto recalls, from detaching wipers at VW to faulty seatbelts at Ford. By the late 2000s, public awareness of notable recalls had slipped to well less than 20 percent ¨¹ even for Toyota's conspicuous unintended-acceleration crisis.
Even if 80 percent of GM owners involved in the ignition-switch recall eventually comply, that amounts to 440,000 unrepaired cars on U.S. roads. What if you're shopping these vehicles? It will be virtually impossible to tell the replaced ignition from the old one, given they look ""substantially similar,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain told us.
""The best way for a future used car buyer to determine if the recall work has been completed is to contact GM Customer Care or a dealer, who can search the service history by VIN [vehicle identification number],"" Cain said. ""It's always a good practice to ask for service records. There are also third-party providers of service history.""
One of them will soon be the NHTSA, which said in 2013 it would add a VIN-searchable database for shoppers to check if their prospective car needs recall work. Automakers have until mid-August to supply recall-tracking data by VIN and update it at least weekly thereafter. VINs are etched beneath the glass at the base of the windshield. NHTSA's database isn't up yet, but spokeswoman Karen Aldana said to expect it ""later this year.""
Still, nothing forces owners to comply with a recall. And AutoPacific product analyst Dave Sullivan warned that as unrepaired cars age, it becomes more inconvenient to schedule the work because dealerships have to back-order parts.
Still, Sullivan said lawmakers could eventually step up enforcement.
""I wouldn't be surprised to see some sort of legislation that requires recalls to be taken care of before a sale takes place,"" he said, adding that it could be ""on the horizon in the next two years.""

House committee members took turns grilling Barra with questions focusing heavily on when it came to the automaker's attention that faulty switches had been used in the 2003-10 Saturn Ion and 2007-10 Sky, the 2006-10 Pontiac Solstice and 2005-10 G5, and the 2006-11 Chevrolet HHR and 2005-07 Cobalt, and why after repeated complaints and defect discoveries in subsequent years the faulty ignition switches continued to be used. Panel members also attempted to get to the bottom of how numerous communication breakdowns between GM and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had occurred.
More GM Ignition Recall News on Cars.com
After reiterating in her opening statement her earlier apology to the victims of the ignition switch problem and their families, Barra repeatedly responded to subcommittee members' questions by saying she would have answers only after GM completed its ongoing internal investigation. One new piece of information Barra did report to House members was that GM has hired lawyer Kenneth Feinberg, who has overseen the victim-compensation process after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the BP oil spill and the Boston Marathon bombing.
 
The ignition switch recall already involves more than 2.5 million vehicles worldwide, with the most recent expansion of nearly 900,000 vehicles announced last week. Meanwhile, millions more GM vehicles have been recalled for problems unrelated to the ignition switch issue ¨¹ first announced in February ¨¹ as the automaker looks to make a good on a public promise to overhaul its safety-assurance procedures. That's after it came to light that GM had first discovered the problem as far back as 2001 during preproduction, canceled a redesigned key four years later and failed to issue a recall until just recently. On March 18, Barra announced that she had appointed company veteran Jeff Boyer to the role of safety chief to oversee safety development of all vehicle systems, including confirmation and validation of safety performance and post-sale activities, particularly recalls.

If you opt for the loaner, that's a lot of time behind the wheel to be underinsured. Remember, a typical collision policy on your personal car insurance policy only covers up to the value of your own car, which puts you at a higher risk in a loaner vehicle. ""Even if the owners of recalled GM cars have collision insurance, coverage is typically limited to the value of their own cars,"" Des Toups, managing editor at CarInsurance.com, told us. ""That is, if you drive a Cobalt worth $7,000 and the dealer lends you a new Cruze worth $18,000, your collision coverage would only pay the value of the Cobalt.""
GM's solution? It will cover the extra insurance.
""We will cover additional costs/insurance for under-insured drivers,"" GM spokesman Jim Cain wrote in an email to Cars.com. The automaker will also cover the extra insurance fees for drivers younger than 25, Cain said, though it may require parent or guardian approval in some states.
Fortunately, that could be a moot point.

Backed by Sens.

The legislation would mandate NHTSA to make info it receives from automakers publicly available in a searchable, user-friendly format so drivers and safety experts can evaluate potential defects. The measure is aimed at correcting what Markey called ""a massive information breakdown"" leading to the deadly ignition-switch situation.

GM disputed the results on grounds that the safety group's crash data correlates fatalities to failed airbag deployments but doesn't necessarily connect those failed deployments to faulty ignition switches.
More on the GM's Ignition-Switch Recall
The recall includes the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion and 2007 Sky, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2005-2007 G5, and the 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and 2005-2007 Cobalt. Questions abound. When will repairs be made? Could the issue affect non-GM cars, too? Where do Pontiac and Saturn owners take their cars? We researched the answers to these questions and reached out to GM spokesman Alan Adler for more information.
Here are some facts, which we'll update if new information becomes available:
Adler said he didn't know if dealers would cover additional insurance in such cases, so a good rule of thumb is that no matter your personal car insurance policy, you should ask the dealer about coverage specifics on the loaner. ""Even if the owners of recalled GM cars have collision insurance, coverage is typically limited to the value of their own cars,"" Toups warned. ""That is, if you drive a Cobalt worth $7,000 and the dealer lends you a new Cruze worth $18,000, your collision coverage would only pay the value of the Cobalt.""

CEO Mary Barra on Tuesday announced that GM veteran Jeff Boyer would take the role, effective immediately. The announcement comes after an intense week for the Detroit automaker as it scrambles to manage a massive recall ¨¹ and the related scrutiny both public and internal ¨¹ of vehicles in which faulty ignition switches have been implicated, directly or indirectly, in hundreds of deaths.
More GM Ignition Recall News
Boyer, 58, has spent nearly 40 years in a wide range of engineering and safety positions at GM. He will have global responsibility with full support from the automaker, according to a GM statement.
""This new role elevates and integrates our safety process under a single leader so we can set a new standard for customer safety with more rigorous accountability,"" Barra said in a statement. ""If there are any obstacles in his way, Jeff has the authority to clear them. If he needs any additional resources, he will get them.""
The worldwide recall of 1.62 million vehicles that touched off all of this includes the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion and 2007 Sky, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2005-2007 G5, and the 2006-2007 Chevrolet HHR and 2005-2007 Cobalt. In the affected vehicles, if the ignition switch moves out of the ""Run"" position, the result would be a partial loss of electrical power and engine shutdown, which could affect functions like power steering and power-assisted brakes. Moreover, an auto-safety group has alleged that 303 people have died as a result of airbags failing to deploy in two of the six recalled models; GM disputes the claim.
""My message will be that we are focused on the customer, we are doing everything we can to support the customer and get their vehicles fixed, that I am very sorry for the loss of life that has occurred and we will take every step that we can to make sure this never happens again,"" the Detroit News quoted Barra as saying. ""The second is we will fix our process.""

USA Today reports the U.S. attorney's office in New York has launched a criminal probe into the recall, which is now responsible for 31 crashes and 12 deaths because of airbags that fail to deploy when the ignition switch is jarred into the Off or Accessory positions leading up to a crash. GM has recalled 1.37 million cars in the U.S. ¨¹ a slew of mid-2000s compact cars, which you can click below to see ¨¹ but court documents from 2013 showed the automaker knew about the issue as early as 2004.

However, it's unclear whether the airbags in those incidents did not deploy specifically because the ignition switch was jarred out of its ""on"" position. That's the reason GM recalled 1.62 million cars worldwide and 1.37 million in the U.S., including the 2003-2007 Saturn Ion and 2007 Sky, the 2006-2007 Pontiac Solstice and 2005-2007 G5, and the 2005-2007 Chevrolet Cobalt and 2006-2007 HHR.
Still, it's a staggering number ¨¹ more than 25 times the 12 deaths that GM linked to the faulty ignition switch earlier this week. The Center for Auto Safety commissioned Texas-based Friedman Research to review federal data of airbag failures, but The New York Times notes that researchers only looked at fatalities from failed airbag deployment, not the reason why those airbags failed.
We'll keep you posted on this.

GM also disclosed that it noted an ignition-switch problem in a preproduction Ion in 2001, but it resolved the issue with an updated switch. The relation to the current recall is unclear, however.
The automaker claims its analysis included reviewing data from crashes involving the Ion, Chevrolet HHR, Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky vehicles. The Chevrolet Cobalt and Pontiac G5 also are part of the recall. ""Today's GM is fully committed to learning from the past while embracing the highest standards for quality and performance now and in the future,"" spokesman Alan Adler told the Detroit News.

Early reports indicate that there have been six fatalities due to the problem that can lead the cars in question to lose power and deactivate airbags.

Realizing this, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced this week that as of Feb. 18, all manufacturers must use a new label to help people instantly recognize a recall notice in the mail.
The Top 10 Biggest Recalls of 2013
""Recalls only work if consumers are aware of them,"" U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Fox said in a statement. ""This new label will allow consumers to quickly recognize recall notices mailed to their homes so they can act quickly to get their vehicles, child restraints, tires or other motor vehicle equipment fixed.""
The use of the new label will be strictly limited to manufacturers issuing a recall. NHTSA will be on the lookout for inappropriate materials that copy the new look and work with authorities to address infractions. ""This measure will help protect consumers from misleading sales and marketing materials that mimic, in their wording and presentation, legitimate safety recall alerts from manufacturers that can lead owners to purchase costly products and services that have no connection to a legitimate safety recall,"" NHTSA stated.
Also this week, NHTSA launched an app for Android devices that provides users free access to up-to-date safety info, including recalls and safety performance. Users can search by vehicle make and model for the agency's five-star safety ratings and subscribe to automatic recall notices. The Android SaferCar app joins the existing iOS version for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.

It began in November 2004 with a small recall on the new-for-2005 Cobalt due to a headlight shield that could loosen and cause additional glare for oncoming traffic. It affected just 1,378 vehicles.
GM spokesman Alan Adler said GM has conducted ""seven safety or non-compliance recalls since production began in '04"" on the Cobalt, adding that repairs were made more than 80 percent of the time. The latest ignition-related recall would make eight, he said.
Still, we found only seven recalls ¨¹ including today's ¨¹ detailed on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website for the Cobalt and G5. If you're shopping for a used one, the 2010 Cobalt has the fewest listed recalls (one), while the 2005-2007 Cobalt and 2007 G5 have the most (four for each model year).
The two nameplates account for 4,503 consumer complaints on NHTSA's website. The agency files complaints related to engine ignition under ""electrical systems,"" which may include other issues. All told, the category accounts for 542 complaints, or 12 percent of the Cobalt/G5 total.
Compared to the Ford Focus ¨¹ a direct competitor manufactured by a domestic automaker ¨¹ the Cobalt's numbers are quite high. Over the same six years, NHTSA reports just two recalls for the Focus and 1,038 total complaints.
Chevrolet is one of GM's four current U.S. brands. The automaker included the G5 in four of the Cobalt's seven recalls.

At least one GM engineer experienced the problem while testing the new car, which went on sale in 2004 as a 2005 model, according to documents from the lawsuit over a crash that killed a 29-year-old woman outside Atlanta in 2010. Pediatric nurse Brooke Melton was driving a Cobalt she had bought new in 2005. She had taken the car to a dealer for ignition-switch problems and had just picked it up the day before her crash.
""GM created a snap-on key cover to try to help with the ignition issue and advised dealers in a 2005 technical service bulletin to install the part if owners complained,"" the newspaper reported. ""Melton's car never got one, and GM did not recall the cars for a mandatory fix until last week.""

The biggest addition to the list isn't a vehicle recall but a tire recall. In December, about 1.2 million Michelin LTX M/X tires, size LT225/75R16, were recalled. The affected tires were used as original equipment on certain Ford vehicles and as replacement equipment on various-brand commercial light trucks, full-size heavy-duty vans, small recreational vehicles and some large pickup trucks. In affected tires the tread could separate, leading to rapid air loss and possibly leading to a loss of vehicle control.
Each year NHTSA issues recalls on millions of vehicles; there were just shy of 18 million in 2012 and 15.5 million the year before. We report on dozens of recalls each year, ranging from actions in the millions of vehicles or components to recalls in the low single digits. The biggest recalls we covered in 2013 are as follows:

From faulty fuel systems on Jeep Liberty and Grand Cherokee SUVs to bad airbag modules in Toyota Corolla and Matrix compacts, 2013 seemed like it had too many recalls to, well, recall. Citing a Monday report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Detroit News said automakers issued 632 recalls that affected nearly 22 million cars in 2013. That's a lot higher than 2012's 581 recalls affecting 16.4 million cars, and it's the highest figure since 2004, when automakers recalled a record 30.8 million cars.
Still, we've found in the past that sky-high recalls don't seem to affect new-car sales that much. See the top 10 biggest recalls of 2013 here, and click below for more details from the Detroit News.

Vehicles Affected: Approximately 522 versions of the 2013 Chrysler 200 and Dodge Avenger sedans, and 2014 versions of the Jeep Compass and Patriot SUVs. Only vehicles equipped with a 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine are affected. The affected vehicles were manufactured between March 15 and April 12, 2013.
The Problem: Abrasive debris in the balance shaft bearings could cause a loss of engine oil pressure, leading to engine failure. If the engine stalls while driving, a crash could result. One fire has been reported and Chrysler is looking into whether it's related to the issue, the automaker said in a statement to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
The Fix: Dealers will replace the engine balance shaft module for free.
What Owners Should Do: Chrysler will notify owners later this month. Owners can call Chrysler at 800-247-9753 or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration at 888-327-4236 for more information.

But how can you find out for certain if your specific vehicle needs to be fixed?
A ruling announced by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration addresses that question and will help give consumers the peace of mind of knowing whether their car is affected by a recall. The new measure, slated to take effect a year from today, requires automakers and motorcycle manufacturers to provide owners and car shoppers with a free online tool that enables them to search recall info by vehicle identification number; the info must be updated weekly.
""Consumers will be able to instantly determine whether action is required to address an uncompleted safety recall that affects their personal vehicle, as identified by their unique VIN,"" NHTSA said in a statement. ""While several automakers already have this feature, those who do not will have until next year to comply with the final rule.""

In 2012, NHTSA recalled just shy of 18 million, and 15.5 million in 2011. While some recalls affect just a handful of vehicles, others impact millions.
So far this year, the biggest recall is technically not a recall at all. In June, we reported that NHTSA had requested Chrysler fix 2.7 million Jeep SUVs ¨¹ 1993-2004 Grand Cherokee and 2002-07 Liberty models ¨¹ due to a potential fuel-system problem that could cause fires in a rear-end crash. Jeep initially refused, insisting the vehicles ""met and exceeded all applicable requirements"" of federal standards pertaining to fuel-system integrity. NHTSA then gave Chrysler a June 18 deadline to either issue a recall themselves, or be ordered to do so.
On the day of its deadline, Chrysler announced it would launch a campaign to inspect and, if necessary, fix the 2.7 million Jeeps ¨¹ never officially referring to the action as a ""recall."" Still, that's what it was, and therefore it earns the distinction of being the biggest one this year.

The larger of the two recalls affects 254,000 model-year 2010-12 Jeep Patriot and Compass SUVs, and it's due to a problem with the occupant-restraint system that could malfunction during slow-developing rollover crashes. The other recall affects an estimated 181,000 model-year 2012-13 Jeep Wrangler SUVs and is due to a problem with the transmission oil cooler line that could cause premature wear.
No accidents, injuries or complaints have resulted from the problems in either recall, Chrysler said in a statement. These two latest recalls are unrelated to an issue earlier this week in which the automaker refused to comply with a NHTSA recommendation that it recall 2.7 million model-year 1993-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee and 2002-07 Liberty SUVs due to a potential fuel-system problem that could lead to fire in a rear-end crash. 
In the first recall, affected vehicles in the Patriot and Compass recall are equipped with sensor-activated restraint systems that deploy when a rollover appears imminent, Chrysler said in a statement. In a slow-developing rollover crash, seat belt pretensioners and side curtain airbags may not function properly.
Chrysler said it will notify affected Patriot and Compass owners directly, and dealers will upgrade the software that controls the restraint system for free.
The Wrangler recall pertains to a power-steering component that may rub against the transmission oil cooler line, causing premature wear that could compromise transmission function. Chrysler said it discovered the problem during routine testing.
The automaker said it will notify Wrangler owners directly and that repair will be made for free. If the transmission oil cooler line shows signs of damage, the line will be replaced; if no damage is evident, the line will be fitted with a protective sleeve as a precaution.
Owners affected by either recall may call the automaker at 800-853-1403 or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's vehicle-safety hotline at 888-327-4236, or go to www.safercar.gov, for more info.

The safety agency says Chrysler ""contravened industry trends,"" as well as its own practices in non-Jeep vehicles by placing the fuel tanks in a vulnerable location behind the rear axle. The resulting fires were caused by gas leaking from punctured fuel tanks in rear-end crashes, causing the deaths of 51 people, the Detroit News reported. 
Automakers refusing to comply with a recall request are uncommon these days, but not uncommon in the past four decades are government investigations of similar fuel-system issues. One of the most well-known cases involved the recall of 1.5 million Ford Pintos and Mercury Bobcats in 1978 after rear crashes resulted in 27 deaths and two-dozen injuries.

95,https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/05/legislation-would-ground-recalled-rental-cars/,Legislation Would Ground Recalled Rental Cars,"A bipartisan group of U.S. senators last week introduced a bill that would prohibit rental-car companies from renting or selling vehicles with an open manufacturer's recall. The legislation, the Raechel and Jacqueline Houck Safe Rental Car Act of 2013, is named for a pair of California girls killed when an unrepaired rental car under recall caught fire due to the defect and caused a head-on collision with a semitrailer.
Existing law prohibits car dealerships from selling recalled vehicles to consumers, but no law bans rental companies from renting them. The bill, first announced in September 2012, is co-sponsored by Sens. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). McCaskill, chairwoman of the Senate Commerce Committee's Consumer Protection subcommittee, said she will hold a hearing on the bill later this month.
""Rental car companies are rolling the dice with passengers' lives each day and every time they rent a car that's under a recall. This practice has already proved tragic,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""We need a law to ensure that recalled cars are never again driven off rental lots.""
Most rental companies have already voluntarily changed their policies about renting or selling recalled vehicles, Schumer noted. According to a news release from Schumer's office, the bill is supported by all the major rental companies ¨¹ Hertz, Enterprise, Avis Budget, Dollar Thrifty and National ¨¹ as well as the American Car Rental Association.
""It is critically important that Congress codify what most of the car rental industry voluntarily enacted last year,"" the American Car Rental Association said in a statement. ""By formally creating a uniform standard, both car-rental and car-sharing customers will have even greater confidence going forward no matter where they rent their vehicles.""
Specific provisions of the bill include:

The vehicles in question, which include nearly three-dozen Ford, Lincoln and Mercury nameplates, lack a brake override system. Ford began installing the system in its U.S. cars in 2010.

Ford wasted little time pointing that out.

A support bracket attached to the headliner could become displaced during a side curtain airbag deployment. If the headliner support bracket makes contact with an occupant during a crash, it could cut them.
In a statement to Cars.com, the automaker said it was aware of one minor injury resulting from the problem. A motorist suffered a cut to his ear during a significant collision in a 2011 Elantra that caused the side curtain airbag to deploy. 
""Upon inspection, we determined that a support bracket for the headliner could become dislodged during the curtain airbaig deployment if the vehicle had an auto dimming mirror installed at the U.S. port of entry,"" Jim Trainor, Hyundai's senior group manager for product public relations, said in the statement. ""In some of these installations, the technician installing the mirror could interact with the headliner in a manner that partially dislodges the bracket, allowing the side curtain airbag deployment to force the bracket to displace during the course of the collision.""
Hyundai will notify owners and expects the remedy to be available in May; dealers will apply adhesive strips to the headliner for free. Owners with questions can call Hyundai at 800-633-5151 or NHTSA's vehicle safety hotline at 888-327-4236. For more info go to www.safercar.gov.

"
99,https://www.cars.com/articles/2013/02/do-recalls-affect-sales/,Do Recalls Affect Sales?,"It suggests that recalls don't faze new-car shoppers ¨¹ in sales, anyway. But they could in other ways. 

Recalls, or the lack thereof, 

should
 affect sales. After all, other news about an automaker does. A report in 2012 by CNW Automotive Research found positive profit statements influenced brand consideration ""somewhat"" or ""a great deal"" for more than 90% of shoppers who planned to buy a car within three months. Recalls, by contrast, ought to send them running. 

When automakers reach a certain threshold, they do. 
Consider Toyota's unintended-acceleration recalls in 2009 and 2010, which cost the automaker dearly in new-car sales. From January to August 2009, the month before the recalls began, 16.6% of all new cars sold wore a Toyota, Scion or Lexus badge. From September 2009 through the end of 2010 ¨¹ a period during which Toyota recalled some 12 million cars because of unintended acceleration and even stopped selling some for short periods ¨¹ the automaker's share of new-car sales fell to 15.8%.
""It was like a snowball effect,"" recalled Polk analyst Tom Libby. ""There was a period in 2010 where there was something being said about Toyota, a negative statement, being made every week.""
Consider 2012's top 10 recall offenders, and sales appear to have little correlation.
""Recalls have become somewhat commonplace, and they are sometimes addressing things that are not necessarily major parts of the vehicle,"" Polk's Libby said. ""People have, in some ways, become numb to them.""
Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power and Associates, agrees.
""Consumers don't spend a lot of time thinking about vehicle recalls compared with sports or entertainment,"" Sargent said. ""At some level it very quickly becomes yesterday's news.""
""There's kind of a difference between recalls and quality,"" Sargent said. ""Recalls are for a specific purpose, and yes, it's a reflection of a quality issue. But it's not the whole quality story.""
In that game, Toyota still plays a good hand. J.D. Power's latest three-year Vehicle Dependability Study rates cars from the 2010 model year ¨¹ right in the thick of Toyota's unintended-acceleration crisis. Among the 32 brands that J.D. Power ranked, Toyota's namesake brand came in fourth. Lexus ranked first; only Scion fell below average. 
""If you've got a car that's 11 years old or older, that implies that you tend to hold onto your vehicle for a long time,"" AutoPacific analyst Ed Kim told us. ""If you're thinking long-term like that, the first thing you tend to think about is durability and reliability. ... Toyota is still king in terms of durability and quality reputation, despite all the things that happened.""

""Toyota also agreed to continue other customer-focused initiatives, including its rapid-response service teams, its expanded network of product quality field offices across the U.S. and a range of customer-care amenities for owners of vehicles subject to certain recalls.""
The settlement marks the latest in a string of penalties for the world's largest automaker, whose unintended acceleration recalls involved around 12 million cars in 2009 and 2010. 

In 2010, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration assessed $48.8 million in civil penalties against Toyota for failing to recall vehicles in a timely manner. The same year, Toyota settled a $10 million wrongful death lawsuit because of unintended acceleration. Toyota 

expanded the recall
 in June 2012 to include the RX SUV from its Lexus luxury division, and in December NHTSA 

levied a $17.35 million fine
 for the delay. That same month, Toyota settled a 

$1.1 billion class-action lawsuit
 on behalf of owners who claimed undue depreciation because of the recalls. Then in January, 

the automaker settled
 the first of hundreds more wrongful injury or death lawsuits related to unintended acceleration that the U.S. District Court consolidated. 

In 2012, Toyota led all U.S. automakers with 5.33 million recalls, but the vast majority were unrelated to unintended acceleration.

NHTSA reports that it received 41,912 safety complaints in 2012, up from 49,417 in 2011 and 65,765 in 2010. Along with consumer feedback, the agency looks at early warning reporting data, technical service bulletins, auto-fan websites, trade publications and automotive magazines to identify potential defects. 
""The role of the consumer in influencing auto recalls cannot be underestimated. Consumers are the lifeblood of the recall process and recalls are often the direct result of a government investigation into consumer complaints."" NHTSA Administrator David Strickland said in a statement. 
Although the number of complaints is falling, the number of vehicles affected by recalls is up. Data from NHTSA shows that around 15.5 million were recalled in 2011. Since the agency started policing and investigating vehicle-related defects in 1966, it has issued 17,000 recalls involving over 500 million vehicles and more than 84 million items of equipment.

If the recall notice lists steps that can be taken to ensure drivers' safety until the parts are ready, the companies are allowed to keep the vehicles on the road until the repair can be performed. Under the legislation, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration would be given the authority to investigate and police the rental car companies. 
Previously, the only major rental car company to voluntarily fix recalls was Hertz. Major holdouts included Avis, Budget, Dollar Thrifty and Enterprise; the latter also owns the Alamo and National brands.

108,https://www.cars.com/articles/2012/08/law-aims-to-end-recalled-rentals/,Law Aims to End Recalled Rentals,"Legislation has been introduced in Congress that would require rental car companies to not rent or sell unrepaired recalled vehicles, according to the Detroit News.
As the law stands now, rental car companies ü which sell, rent and buy millions of vehicles a year ü don't have to disclose that a vehicle has been recalled nor do they have to fix the issue, according to the Detroit paper.
The legislation, co-sponsored by prominent U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), would prohibit the rental of vehicles under a safety recall. The bill was introduced after two people were killed in 2004 when their unrepaired recalled Chrysler PT Cruiser, which was rented from Enterprise, caught fire and crashed.
The rental car industry has been under pressure for some time to make these rules standard; Boxer sent a letter to several large rental car firms urging them to stop renting recalled vehicles earlier this year. Only Hertz agreed to stop the practice, according to the Detroit News.
Enterprise, Avis and Dollar Thrifty say they repair their vehicles whenever it is practical to do so and ground vehicles when a manufacturer recommends the action. These three major rental firms dispute the proposed l legislation's plan to ground all unrepaired recalled vehicles because they say some recalls are for only minor issues and would disrupt their business unnecessarily.
GM and Chrysler have told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that only about 30% of cars sold to rental companies were repaired within 90 days of a recall and more than 50% were repaired within a year. Earlier this year, CarFax found nearly 2.7 million vehicles on sale with safety recalls still open.

On those vehicles, the engine shield under the vehicle could cause an engine fire, according to the automaker. An improper oil change could result in oil dripping onto the engine shield, which may ignite and burn, possibly causing an engine compartment fire.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration already opened a preliminary investigation in April for this issue as a result of two engine compartment fires in 2011 Cruzes and later added the 2012 model year, GM says. 
Another voluntary recall will assure that all the welds were completed on the rear compartment of the Cruze. GM has discovered that 249 Cruze vehicles may have missed some welding during production that could affect the fuel-tank strap secondary bracket attached to the floor structure and sub-assembly of the rear floor pan.
Owners of the affected vehicles will receive recall notices starting July 11, GM says. The modification of the engine shield will take about 30 minutes and will be conducted free of charge. Owners who have their Cruze recalled for the welding error will have the issue fixed if necessary, with the repairs taking about three hours to complete.

NHTSA eventually attributed the unintended-acceleration accidents to driver error, stuck accelerator pedals and faulty floormats, and the agency issued massive recalls of the affected vehicles. The group concluded that the vehicles' electronic throttle control (ETC) systems weren't causing the unintended acceleration but asked NASA to investigate further; NASA corroborated NHTSA's findings. The safety group also commissioned a panel for advice on handling future ETC issues.
""NHTSA will need to become more familiar with how manufacturers design safety and security into electronics systems, identify and investigate system faults that may leave no physical trace, and respond convincingly when concerns arise about system safety,"" the panel said in a press release. 
The panel also found it disturbing that NHTSA failed to confidently and convincingly address the public's concern about ETC systems.

Toyota is voluntarily recalling about 245,000 Lexus cars sold in the U.S. because of a possible problem with the fuel pressure sensor installation. The models affected by the recall are 2006-07 GS 300 and GS 350, 2006-09 IS 250, and 2006-08 IS 350. Insufficient tightening of the fuel pressure sensor, which is connected to some engine fuel delivery pipes that have nickel-phosphorus plating, may cause the pressure sensor to loosen. If this happens, fuel could leak past a gasket thatüs used in the connection between the sensor and the fuel delivery pipe. It could also leak through the threaded part of the sensor.  Toyota says there are no warnings that this may occur. However, if fuel is leaking from the fuel pressure sensor, owners may notice a fuel odor coming from the engine compartment. If they do so, Toyota recommends they take it to their dealer for servicing immediately.  There have been four complaints, Toyota says, but there have been no reports of accidents due to the defect. Many of the vehicles in question were previously recalled in January 2009 for fuel lines that experienced corroding over time. Three of the four reports of the current defect were of vehicles not involved in that recall, but one was, leading to the wider range of vehicles involved in the recall.  Toyota is determining how long it will take to produce enough replacement parts before determining a launch date for the recall, which will involve mailings to customers. Recall notices usually include such a datee, but Toyota has sped up the reporting process because of its recent history of recall issues.  Once the recall begins, Lexus dealers will inspect cars for fuel leakage. If no leakage is found, they will tighten the fuel pressure sensor. However, if a leak is found, the gasket between the sensor and fuel delivery pipe will be replaced, and the sensor will be tightened. There will be no charge for the inspection and, if necessary, gasket replacement.  The automaker will notify owners of the recall once the necessary parts have been obtained. For more info, owners can call Lexus at 800-255-3987 or go to www.lexus.com/recall. Toyota also issued a separate recall for 1.3 million cars worldwide today over a separate problem with a fuel delivery pipe.

The final model year of the current-generation Hyundai Elantra has $1,500 cash back, about the same amount that Honda is offering for its Civic. The popular-selling Hyundai Sonata has no cash back and a 2.9% financing deal for 60 months. Overall, the Korean automakers, which usually offer as generous of incentives as the profligate domestic automakers, are now pretty much in line with tightfisted Honda.
That doesn¨¹t mean there aren¨¹t deals to be had from Hyundai; it¨¹s just that most offers are leasing promotions. The 2011 Sonata gets a $199-per-month leasing promotion for November, and so does the Elantra Touring.

The agency is advising potentially affected Ford owners to watch for potential warning signs of an imminent vehicle fire.

There have been no accidents or injuries due to the malfunctioning pump, BMW says. Many owners report having the part replaced numerous times.

The people highlighting their harrowing experiences on ABC may showcase a lack of driver education combined with BMW over-engineering its cars. Typically, a car would just stop driving completely if the fuel pump failed. The power steering would also fail, making it difficult to steer the car and safely avoid traffic. BMWüs ülimp homeü mode allows the driver to pull over to the side of the road safely or drive at slower speeds until you get to your local dealer. 

  

Dozens of complaints about the fuel pump problem appear on NHTSAüs website, and they may illustrate this lack of education. Hereüs one excerpt: ü10/8/2010 ü While traveling on Alligator Alley in Southern Florida, 2009 BMW 335i experienced a severe loss of power with engine lamp turning on. Loss of power worsened for the next seventy five miles until the car could not go over forty miles per hour and had insufficient torque to go up any inclined highway off ramps.ü 

Weüre not blaming drivers for the failure of the fuel pumps, and it sounds like this is a serious flaw in what is otherwise a very good engine. But when your engine suffers a severe event with a warning light illuminating, weüd advise all drivers to pull over when safe and call a service vehicle. BMW spokesman Matthew Russell says the company has tested the limp home mode on a 135i and it performed aerformed at a reduced performance level, but one that was comparable to a lesser-powered 128. Russell also said different transmissions would react differently, with an automatic transmission locking you out of higher gears. 

  

BMW offers free roadside assistance for the first four years of ownership and if you buy a certified pre-owned BMW, you get free roadside assistance until the sixth year of the original service date. 

The recall does not include all 2010 BMW models with this engine. The 2010 BMW 335is and 740i are not included. The engine in 2011 BMWs is a different turbocharged six-cylinder that has a newer fuel pump design and is not included in the recall.

The vehicles being recalled were built between Dec. 4 and Dec. 23, 2009; you can check your car¨¹s manufacture date on the sticker inside the driver-side doorjamb.

Yes, the issue is similar to the one certain Toyota models faced, but the defect is mechanical in nature, not from the design of the pedals. 

  

Under certain conditions, bushings can dislodge and stop the accelerator pedal from returning to the idle position. The pedal is supplied by the same company, CTS, as the defective Toyota pedals. 

All Chrysler products since 2003 have brake override systems in place. 

This recall affects only Calibers built between March 7 and May 19, 2006, that are equipped with continuously variable automatic transmissions.

 This addresses the recall Toyota issued for 2000-2003 model year Tundras earlier this year. While all of the pickup trucks are eligible regardless of their geographic location, dealers will only replace the frame if holes due to rust can be found.

 In some of these vehicles, there is a defect with the front seat so that if it¨¹s adjusted to an extreme position, the mating components may break and the seat-belt locking mechanism can¨¹t be trusted. The seat-belt mount could break from the anchoring system when the belt is fastened or open. In a crash, the belt could fail, increasing the risk of injury or death for any passengers. 
 Dealers will install an additional locking element on the seat-belt anchoring system for both of the front seats for free. Owners may contact NHTSA¨¹s vehicle safety hot line at 888-327-4236.

 The recall affects vehicles manufactured between Dec. 15, 2009, and Feb. 3, 2010, and equipped with front seat manual recliners. The recliner gear plate teeth for the head restraint may have improper dimensions and could result in ¨¹limited pawl to gear plate tooth engagement.¨¹ This means during a crash the seatback and head restraint may slip backward, which could increase the risk of injury.
 Dealers will replace the manual recliners for power or manual seats. The fix will be free of charge.

Toyota to Recall '03 Sequoia
(Detroit News)
"
140,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/04/toyota-addresses-2003-sequoia-recall/,Toyota Addresses 2003 Sequoia Recall," Earlier today, 

news broke that Toyota would initiate yet another recall, this time for the 2003 Sequoia SUV
. Now, the company has released a statement on the problem and how and when it will fix ownersü vehicles. 

Read the automakerüs statement below: 

Toyota Announces Voluntary Recall on 2003 Model-Year Sequoia to Upgrade Program Logic in Vehicle Stability Control System
Torrance, Calif., April 28, 2010 ü Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A., Inc., today announced it will conduct a voluntary safety recall on approximately 50,000 early-2003 Model-Year Toyota Sequoia sport utility vehicles to upgrade program logic in its Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system. 

  

The VSC system can help control a loss of traction in turns as a result of front or rear tire slippage during cornering.  In vehicles without the upgrade, the VSC system could, in limited situations, activate at low speed (approximately 9 mph) for a few seconds after acceleration from a stopped position and, as a result, the vehicle may not accelerate as quickly as the driver expects.  There have been no reported injuries or accidents as a result of this condition. 

  

Toyota instituted a running production change during the 2003 model year and nd published a Technical Service Bulletin to address this issue when it was first identified in fall 2003. Since that time, Toyota has been responding to individual owner concerns by replacing the Skid Control Engine Control Unit (ECU) in Sequoias impacted by this condition.  Of the approximately 50,000 vehicles included in this recall, approximately half have already been serviced under warranty. 

  

Steve St. Angelo, Toyota chief quality officer for North America, said: üToyota is committed to investigating customer complaints more aggressively and to responding quickly to issues we identify in our vehicles.  As a result, we are voluntarily launching this recall to ensure that as many 2003 Sequoias as possible are serviced to the full satisfaction of our customers.ü 

  

Starting in late May, Toyota will begin mailing letters to all 2003 Model-Year Sequoia owners included in this recall, including owners of vehicles that have been previously serviced. If a customer has previously paid to replace the Skid Control ECU for this specific condition prior to receiving a letter, the customer should mail a copy of their repair order, to the following address for reimbursement consideration: Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., Toyota Customer Experience, WC 10, 19001 South Western Avevenue, Torrance, CA 90509.

  Acura is recalling about 167,000 2004-08 TSX sedans equipped with the 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine. The defect involves a power-steering hose that can deteriorate prematurely and crack, leading to a leak and loss of power steering that may result in smoke or fire. One incident of a fire has been reported. 
 The recall will begin in May. Owners can have a new power-steering hose, O-ring gasket and fluid replaced at no cost. Owners can contact Acura at owners.acura.com/recalls or at (800) 382-2238.

The recall is due to a faulty joint that can crack and possibly lead to the driveshaft falling off. The same recall affected the 2010 Toyota Tacoma. 

 Five-hundred Tundras were fixed in the factory, but two found their way to dealerships and were sold before the fix could be made. PickupTrucks.com has the full story.

141,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/03/recall-alert-20072008-honda-odyssey-element/,"Recall Alert: 2007-2008 Honda Odyssey, Element"," Honda is recalling 344,000 2007-2008 Honda Odyssey minivans and 68,000 2007-2008 Element SUVs due to a faulty antilock brake modulator, which is considered part of the stability control system. Air can slowly enter the part and cause issues over time. The fault directly affects the brake pedal feel and height. Over time, the pedals can start to feel üsoftü and the height can decrease. 

The recall has been submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and notices will be mailed to owners after April 19. When owners receive the notice, Honda advises them to schedule a service appointment with their dealer immediately.   

According to Honda spokesman Chris Martin, before this announcement, owners with this issue would likely have been told that there was air in the brake system and it would have been bled, fixing the problem, until the system started to slowly let in air again. 

Honda did not post the number of complaints, but we checked NHTSAüs website, and as of today we found 140 complaints for 2007-2008 Odysseys for brakes, a majority for the faded-brake issue. Ten of those included crashes, with seven reported injuries. There were 17 complaints with one crash and injury for the 2007-2008 Element. We did find at least one duplicate complaint (which we didnüt count). However, we didnüt cross-check all 157 complaints. 

Martin said taid the pedal feel would decrease gradually over time, but a number of complaints registered mileage between 2,000 and 5,000 miles before noticing reduced brake feel. Some, less. 

Interestingly enough, in my 

review of the 2008 Odyssey
 I noted that the brakes were actually ¨¹firm and precise¨¹ compared with others in the segment. Honda vehicles overall have a reputation for more aggressive braking than their competitors, so if you notice any sort of ¨¹mushy¨¹ feeling in an Odyssey or Element, it could have an issue. 

Concerned owners will have to wait until the April 19 date to get more details via Honda's 

www.recalls.honda.com
 site or at (800) 999-1009 and select option 4. You can contact NHTSA¨¹s vehicle safety hot line at any time at 888-327-4236.

The 2005-2007 model year Corolla and Matrix may have faulty engine control units leading to stalled engines. There had been 76 complaints on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration¨¹s website regarding the issue as of earlier this month. 
Toyota says the problem could occur in 0.8% of the models over 10 years and that it would always lead to an engine warning light and a stalled engine. By our math, that would be 9,600 cars. 
 The Free Press says that any action could also affect the 2005-2007 Pontiac Vibe, which was built at the same plant as the Matrix.

One of the two controversial Toyota Prius crashes earlier this month is now being attributed to driver error, according to the National Highway Traffic Administration. However, the information released by the agency was brief:¨¹Information retrieved from the vehicle's onboard computer systems indicated there was no application of the brakes and the throttle was fully open.""USA Today reports that there was no further explanation or any mention of when more details might become available. But at first glance, the fact that no brakes were used and the gas was at full throttle does suggest driver error or depressing the wrong pedal.Toyota is not commenting on this case, despite heavy criticism of a separate incident in California. Instead, Toyota says it will wait for the police report to be made public before making a statement.

 These include vehicles originally sold or currently registered in Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin and Washington, D.C. Cold states (and their adjoining states) that use road salts frequently are also included: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina. 
 The recall is due to a reinforcing bracket and the fuel filler pipe, which could corrode if exposed to salt and other road debris. This could create a leak in the fuel filler pipe and possibly lead to a fire in the presence of an ignition source. 
 Dealers will inspect the fuel filler pipe and replace it with an improved part for free. Owners may contact Mitsubishi at 800-222-0037 or NHTSA¨¹s vehicle safety hot line at 888-327-4236.

 Some of these vehicles have a hose fitting at the caliper on the front brake that may corrode from exposure to snow or water containing road salt or other contaminants, which could get into the routing sleeve. If the fitting corrodes enough, the brake hose-tube interface may develop a leak, which could increase vehicle stopping distance and lead to an accident.
 Dealers will replace both front brake hose assemblies for free. The recall is not expected to begin until May. Owners may contact Cadillac at 866-982-2339 or NHTSA¨¹s hot line at 888-327-4236.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
. 

The recall is due to a defect in the fasteners securing the front passenger seat¨¹s airbag module as well as the ones securing the steering shaft positioning bracket, which may not have been tightened to the right torque specification. 
During a crash, it¨¹s possible that the trajectory of the front airbag might be affected when it deploys. If the fasteners come out of the steering column, they could also increase the risk of a crash. 
Dealers will inspect both the steering column and front passenger airbag fasteners, replace any missing fasteners and tighten any loose ones to the correct specification for free. Owners may contact Suzuki at 800-934-0934 or the NHTSA¨¹s hot line at 888-327-4236.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
. 

The recall is due to a defective locking hook on the sun shield, which may not engage correctly into the lock catch on the windscreen frame of the car. If the sun shield is not locked in place, it could open when driving at high speeds and create a major safety hazard. The Spyder is a special-edition model with a removable soft-top. The limited run is likely the reason for such a small number of recalled vehicles.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
. 

 Subaru notified the agency about a defect in models manufactured between Sept. 4, 2009 and March 8, 2010: the door latch cables in the front doors were not positioned properly during the manufacturing process. A cable could get caught in the door glass regulator when a window is opened or closed, which could unlatch the door and cause it to open unexpectedly when rolling a window up or down.
 This creates a risk that an occupant could be ejected as well as other hazardous situations that could lead to a crash. It could also lead to the door being caught and unable to open, which could make for a dangerous situation if a vehicle occupant had to get out quickly.
 Subaru dealers will repair the vehicles by repositioning and securing the latch cable in both front doors. The service is free of charge. Owners may contact Subaru at 800-782-2783 or NHTSA¨¹s hot line at 888-327-4236.

 A front crash sensor may crack in certain cold environments and allow water to leak into the sensor, causing it to fail. This will illuminate the airbag warning light, at which point the owner should get the vehicle serviced. If the front crash sensors don¨¹t work, the airbag may fail to deploy in an accident.
 Chrysler will replace the front airbag sensor with a new one with an improved design for free. The campaign will not begin until June, however. Owners may contact Chrysler at 800-853-1403 or NHTSA¨¹s vehicle safety hotline at 888-327-4236.

143,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/car-seats-path-to-recall-took-10-years-/,Car Seat's Path to Recall Took 10 Years ," As we examine the headline-crashing Toyota recalls, itüs instructive to look at a child-safety seat recall that took almost 10 years as an example of a complicated recall process. Dorel Juvenile Group just issued a recall of 4 million child restraints, even though most of the children who sat in those seats are now teenagers. 

 The recall was issued in 2001 when the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that some straps for the seats ü sold under Cosco and Eddie Bauer brands ü might weaken by 25% over time and fail to properly restrain a child during a crash. In 2002 Dorel appealed, saying the NHTSA standard made no sense because it did not specify what the original strap strength had to be and that the restraints, even when weakened by 25%, were still stronger than cheaper restraints used by competitors.
 Safety advocates even agreed with Dorelüs point. Nonetheless, in 2008 ü six years after the appeal ü the NHTSA denied the request. Dorel appealed once again, but just now ü in 2010 ü Dorel was finally told it had to proceed with the recall. Thiall. This seems bizarre, seeing as how Dorel does not recommend that anyone use restraints who are 10 years old.
 It¨¹s important to note that the child-seat industry is regulated differently from automotive industry, which likely led to this delay.

 This recall only affects Camrys with a four-cylinder engine. The problem is with a power-steering hose that may be in contact with a front brake tube, which could create a hole in the tube and allow brake fluid to leak. This could negatively impact the effectiveness of braking in the vehicle.

143,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/recall-alert-2010-toyota-tacoma/,Recall Alert: 2010 Toyota Tacoma," Toyota is voluntarily recalling approximately 8,000 four-wheel drive Tacoma pickups to fix a potential problem with the front propeller shaft, a Toyota spokesman said today. The issue: a crack can develop in the rear joint that may lead to the driveshaft separating and falling away from the truck, causing the vehicle to lose control. The problem can occur without warning, according to a Toyota recall bulletin sent to Toyota dealers today. 

The prop shaft sends power to the truck's front wheels when it's in four-wheel drive. Two-wheel drive pickups are not included in the recall, according to Toyota. 

The condition was discovered during the manufacturing process of the front prop shaft at the supplier, Dana Corporation, that you may recall was also involved in the frame rust recall issue with first generation Toyota Tundras. 

The affected Toyota Tacoma models were produced from mid-December 2009, to early February 2010. 

""Most of the vehicles [included in the recall] are in the pipeline in Toyota's distribution system or on dealer lots,"" Brian Lyons, Toyota's head of safety communications told PickupTrucks.com on Friday afternoon. 

Toyota dealers will perform a 10-minute visual inspection of the trucks included in the recall, according to the dealer notice. Based on the results, the prop shaft may be replaced at no charge to the customer. Toyota will notify owners by mail starting by mid-March. 

Owners may also contact the Toyota Customer Experience Center (1-800-331-4331) for additional assistance.

143,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/recall-alert-2010-bmw-x5-x6/,"Recall Alert: 2010 BMW X5, X6"," BMW has issued a recall for 2010 X5 and X6 vehicles, according to the 

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
. 

 The recall is only for the SUVs manufactured between Dec. 14, 2009, and Dec. 16, 2009, because the bonding in the upper right part of the windshield may be insufficient. In a rollover accident, this could negatively impact the stability of the roof and increase the risk of injury to passengers. 
 BMW has not provided a fix or an owner notification schedule for this recall, though it likely affects only a small number of vehicles. Owners may contact BMW at 800-831-1117 or NHTSA¨¹s vehicle safety hot line at 888-327-4236. 
"
143,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/inside-toyotas-recall-solutions/,Inside Toyota's Recall Solutions,"In a three-hour session on Thursday, Toyota summarized and demonstrated for reporters what it¨¹s doing to correct the acceleration and braking problems that led it to recall millions of cars around the world. The fixes they¨¹re employing address both short- and long-term solutions as the automaker looks to remove consumer doubts about the quality of its vehicles.
Since repairs started Feb. 5, Toyota dealers have processed more than 50,000 vehicles a day, but many observers, including U.S. lawmakers preparing for congressional hearings about the Toyota recalls next week, want to know exactly when Toyota became aware of the problem. 
""The [sticky pedal] defect was first noticed in late October last year,"" said John Hanson, Toyota's U.S. manager of safety communications. ""We started discussions with [pedal supplier] CTS about the issue and how it might be remedied. At that time, we also notified NHTSA of the trend, before we knew what the fix was going to be. From late October to end of the year was the development of both a field remedy and an assembly line remedy simultaneously.""
By late January, both a fix and newly redesigned pedals were available when Toyota stopped production and sales of the eight models affected by the recall. Toyota took 25,000 of the redesigned pedals, originally intended for production, and made them available to dealers.
Mike Michels, Toyota vice president of communications, said, ""25,000 [redesigned] pedals went to fix the most urgent needs at dealers. The pedal was already broken or couldn't be repaired to expedite things. Some customers had cars they didn't want to drive and the new pedals were used for that. Or if the vehicle had just been purchased. We also determined that some pedals wouldn't be repairable with the spacer remedy. These are the backup if we can't repair the pedal for some reason.""
Some drivers might notice a slight difference in the feel of the accelerator pedal after the shim has been installed.
Eventually, all Toyota cars and trucks will have new brake versus accelerator software. But what about enthusiasts who might want to take their car or truck to the drag strip and use their foot brake to ""brake torque"" the vehicle while they simultaneously hit the throttle?
Paul Williamsen, national manager at Lexus College, Toyota's dealer training school, said that as long as the brake is pushed down before the accelerator, enthusiasts can continue to launch their vehicles with both pedals at the same time.
Toyota first became aware of complaints from 2010 Prius owners last fall when the weather turned cold. In certain conditions, under what was described as medium braking, when the ABS would sense a skid, it would release the brake pressure ""longer than the driver might like, creating an uncomfortable feeling,¨¹ said Brian Lyons, Toyota's safety communications spokesperson. The ABS on the Lexus HS 250h shares a similar component design to the 2010 Prius, which is why it was included in this recall.
Toyota demonstrated the software update for us. Although it took more than 5 minutes in our demonstration, Toyota says the ABS computer can be reflashed in as little as 2 minutes. Either way, it didn't require any new hardware.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
. 

 The recall is due to a problem with the seat belts. Some of the ¨¹04 9-3s were produced with front seat-belt retractors that could fail. 
 If the belt does not properly retract during a crash, the occupant might not be restrained, which could lead to serious injury.
 Dealers will replace the seat-belt retractor for free on the driver¨¹s side. For the passenger side, Saab will provide only special warranty coverage that will last 10 years from a new vehicle¨¹s date of sale.

			    	In what it¨¹s calling an ¨¹additional measure of confidence,¨¹ Toyota is adding a brake override system to three additional models involved in two major recalls. However, the new total of eight models receiving this upgrade is still short of the 15 models involved in either 

 the sticky accelerator pedal recall, the improper fitting floormat recall
 or 

the more recent recall of the Toyota Prius and Lexus HS 250h hybrid
 for faulty braking systems. And Toyota stresses that the brake override system is not an actual remedy for the defects. 

The new models include the 2005-2010 Tacoma, 2009-2010 Venza and 2008-2010 Sequoia. They join the 2007-2010 Camry, 2005-2010 Avalon, 2007-2010 Lexus ES 350, 2006-2010 IS 350 and 2006-2010 IS 250, which are already slated to receive the new system.

143,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/reality-check-many-cars-face-recalls/,Reality Check: Many Cars Face Recalls," Though the Toyota recall is one of the largest and most rapid in the history books, we want to let readers know that recalls are something 

we cover at KickingTires regularly
. Months prior to Toyota's recent recall, there were numerous others that dealt with potential fires, brake failure and faulty airbag deployments. Not any of them were as extensive as the 2.3 million vehicles Toyota recalled in January, however. 

In November and December of 2009, Chrysler issued a recall for 161,000 Jeep Wranglers that left the factory without transmission temperature sensors, which could lead to transmission overheating and potential fire. Honda recalled 141,000 Fits for a potential faulty window switch that could result in a fire. Hyundai recalled 65,000 Azeras for a wiring harness that could fail and prevent airbag deployment. And these were just the larger and more significant of more than a dozen recalls issued over that time, which we list further below.

 The Office of Defects Investigation ü a division within the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ü investigates consumer safety complaints and other available data to find out if a vehicle defect exists. Although most automakers will initiate a recall voluntarily, NHTSA has the authority to order a manufacturer recall. Typically, after NHTSA announces a recall publicly, it can still take months before the automaker sends notices to consumers on how to get the problem remedied. 

Evaluating consumer safety complaints is one of the first steps NHTSA takes to open an investigation that could lead to a recall. You can submit a safety complaint at Safercar.gov, though a high number of complaints doesn't always correlate to a recall being issued. Of the 2009 Honda Accord's 125 complaints, many are for squealing brakes, which hasn't resulted in an investigation or recall. The 2009 Toyota Camry has 47 complaints about acceleration issues, most of them unintended acceleration. And only three of those complaints were received since the most rececent recall in January.

According to CTS Automotive Products, the supplier of the faulty part, there have been no accidents or injuries due to the faulty pedal. 

No Camry Hybrid models are included
 in this recall, and 

some of the model year Camrys actually have a different pedal
 installed than the one affected by the recall; only a qualified technician will be able to tell the difference between the two pedals. All sales of these recalled models have been halted. New parts are on their way to assembly plants, but there has been no word on a fix for current owners. 

The earlier floormat recall was announced after a fatal accident involving a Lexus sedan. This is a wider ranging recall involving more models and brands, including Lexus; it was just expanded by 1.1 million vehicles to 5.3 million vehicles. The vehicles in the floormat recall include: 

 A series of steps have been developed to fix the problem involving the floormats, including shortening the gas pedal. In some cars, a brake-override system will be installed to allow drivers of runaway vehicles to stop the car.

2.3 million vehicles recalled
 two weeks ago. The company will start to send the necessary parts by the end of the week and says some dealers will stay open 24 hours to accommodate such a large number of owners affected by the recall. 

By far the most daunting aspect of the recall was not stopping sales or halting production ¨¹ assembly lines will go dormant this week until entirely new pedals reach them ¨¹ but tackling the enormous number of cars already on the road. 

Toyota is in an all-out media offensive to get the word out that it has come up with a remedy, but it¨¹s unknown how big an impact the recall will have on the car-buying public. 

However, it¨¹s almost unprecedented for a recall to be announced and remedied in less than two weeks. Toyota says it is already training technicians on how to repair the cars, trucks and SUVs under the recall. 

Notifications should be going out later this week. We recommend contacting your dealer to find out when it is expecting the parts and see if it¨¹s possible to schedule your service ahead of time.

It can smoke, melt and even catch fire. Unfortunately, a fatal accident involving a child led to the recall. 

Honda explained: ""Under some severe operating conditions, water, rain, or other liquid may enter the driver's window and reach the master power window switch, resulting in impaired function of the switch. If the master power window switch is damaged as a result of the liquid intrusion, it may result in failure of the switch and overheating.¨¹

144,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/02/engineers-say-all-cars-vulnerable-to-unintended-acceleration/,Engineers Say Not Just Toyotas Vulnerable to Unintended Acceleration," The Detroit Free Press talked to a number of engine experts who explain that with electronic systems controlling an engineüs acceleration, cell phone signals and microwave and radio towers could lead to unintended acceleration. This would happen on all cars, including past Toyotas not part of the recall that have been reported to accelerate out of control. 

However, Toyota says its throttle-control system has fail-safes for such an occurrence and these parts would return a specific error when brought in for repair. 

Since the most recent Toyota recall, many analysts are calling for Toyota and others to add üsmart brakeü technology that would allow depressing the brake pedal to override the throttle control, thus canceling any acceleration, intended or otherwise. Most European and luxury automakers and Nissan already use smart brake technology, but Ford, GM, Chrysler, Honda and Toyota do not. 

Overall, unintended acceleration is fairly rare no matter the cause. Based on a Consumer Reports study of 2008 complaints to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, about one of every 50,000 Toyota, one of every 65,000 Ford ad and just one in every 500,000 GM vehicles experienced a problem.

A new recall announced today by Toyota includes approximately 2.3 million Toyota cars, trucks and SUVs. No Lexus or Scion models are included. The recall is to fix accelerator pedals that become stuck and lead to severe accidents. This recall is separate from the 4.2 million vehicles recalled over floormats trapping the accelerator pedal. Toyota says 1.7 million vehicles are included in both recalls.Below is Toyota¨¹s explanation as well as the models affected. 
¨¹The condition is rare, but can occur when the pedal mechanism becomes worn and, in certain conditions, the accelerator pedal may become harder to depress, slower to return or, in the worst case, stuck in a partially depressed position.  Toyota is working quickly to prepare the correction remedy.""In the event that a driver experiences an accelerator pedal that sticks in a partial open throttle position or returns slowly to idle position, the vehicle can be controlled with firm and steady application of the brakes. The brakes should not be pumped repeatedly because it could deplete vacuum assist, requiring stronger brake pedal pressure. The vehicle should be driven to the nearest safe location, the engine shut off and a Toyota dealer contacted for assistance.¨¹Model included in the recall: ¨¹ 2009-10 RAV4¨¹ 2009-10 Corolla¨¹ 2009-10 Matrix¨¹ 2005-10 Avalon¨¹ 2007-10 Camry¨¹ 2010 Highlander¨¹ 2007-10 Tundra¨¹ 2008-10 SequoiaABC News is reporting more than 60 new cases of unintended acceleration in Toyota vehicles since the safety recall campaign last year. Unintended acceleration in a 2008 Toyota led to a December crash that left four people dead. Investigators found the car¨¹s floormats in the trunk, where Toyota had recommended putting them so as not to get stuck under the accelerator.Another person said he had watched an ABC news report on what to do if a car didn¨¹t respond and was able to get his Toyota into a dealership where they could diagnose the problem and fix the electronic components responsible. This incident may be what is spurring Toyota to issue a new recall.

145,https://www.cars.com/articles/2010/01/toyota-recall-answering-your-questions-/,Toyota Recall: Answering Your Questions  ," These are uncertain times for the people who own 

the 2.3 million Toyota and Pontiac vehicles recalled yesterday
 for a defective accelerator pedal. This latest recall comes after several reports of Toyota cars that accelerated uncontrollably, including one tragic case where a family died after the loaner they were driving went out of control in Southern California. We talked with Toyotaüs John Hanson, national manager for environmental safety and quality, to clarify a number of questions. 

How do I know my car has a problem now?
Hanson says, üThe accelerator might feel a little balky or stiff or rough when you depress it. The pedal may be slow to return to its original position after you let up on it. It wonüt spring back like it used to.ü If you notice any of these symptoms contact your dealer immediately. The problem is progressive, meaning if you feel a slight change, it likely will get worse over time.

Is there a fix for the problem?
Toyota has yet to announce how they will fix the problem. If owners experience any sort of unusual feedback from the accelerator pedal they should call their dealer immediately for a diagnosis and repair. Hanson could not confirm that replacing the worn assembly with a new one is what dealers are being told to do, but that fix should delay problems until differently sourced units arrive. 

What if my dealer canüt or wonüt fix the problem? 
Hanson says deays dealers have been instructed to take vehicles on a case-by-case basis, and if owners are concerned that their vehicle wasnüt properly treated by the dealer, they should call Toyota Customer Service at 800-331-4331. 

Are all the vehicles in the recall prone to unintended acceleration?
Each car is equipped with the faulty system, Hanson said, but the recall is the result of a wear issue, meaning it takes a certain amount of use before problems arise. Hanson could not give a time frame or mileage driven that owners can look for to know if their car is at risk. The vehicles known to have the issue all vary in those regards, which he says was one reason it took so long to diagnose the problem. If you just bought a new Toyota, it will likely take time for a problem to occur, but, again, there is no known mileage or time because climate and daily use can impact the amount of wear.   

Are new cars with the faulty system still being sold on dealer lots?
No, Toyota announced it has stopped selling all models included in the recall. 

Is Toyota still building new models involved in the recall?
 Yes, but production will halt on Feb. 1. Thhose vehicles assembled before then will not go on sale. 

When will more information be available about a fix?
Developing a solution may take some time, but Hanson said more information about the process would likely be announced in a few weeks. Hanson said Toyota is working ¨¹rapidly¨¹ to develop a fix.

A Toyota spokesman said, ¨¹This action is necessary until a remedy is finalized. We¨¹re making every effort to address this situation for our customers as quickly as possible.¨¹
The company says it will also stop production of the same vehicles starting Feb. 1. The delay is likely due to the complications of leaving vehicles unfinished on the line for an extended period of time. 

This is dramatic action, amid public outcry, because it includes two of the company¨¹s and the country¨¹s best-selling models, the Toyota Camry and Corolla.

, not every gasoline-powered 2007-10 Camry is affected by the recall of 2.3 million Toyotas. Camrys are built on multiple assembly lines and plants, and the faulty part was not used on all of them. The only line that did not receive the part is 

the Camry Hybrid
 line in Georgetown, Ky., plant, according to Toyota. 

Other Camrys, which were built side by side at that same Kentucky factory, were made with either a faulty or unaffected part. That is making it hard for Toyota to tell us an easy way for owners and perspective buyers to inspect a Camry for the faulty part. Thereüs no set of vehicle identification numbers to look for at this time, and the point of assembly also will not clarify which models are which. 

Unlike what weüve read in other published reports, Toyota spokesman John Hanson says the average owner wonüt likely be able to tell the difference between the parts. However, a trained technician would be able to tell, and a dealer is allowed legally to sell those inspected Ced Camrys to buyers. 

We¨¹re unsure if anyone has attempted to buy a new Camry since the recall, but do not be quick to say a dealer is doing something wrong if he¨¹s selling a Camry. We¨¹d caution any buyer to do their due diligence if they¨¹re contemplating a new or used Camry purchase.

 Originally, NHTSA's investigation covered only 2000-01 Tundras but during Toyota's investigation of the problem, the number of trucks discovered with the problem grew to include 2002 and 2003 models. 

Toyota has just announced the recall, but NHTSA recommends that owners remove the spare tires before taking the trucks to the dealers to be remedied. 

In addition, the corrosion may also cause damage to the rear brake lines and lead to brake system failures. 

The states in the recall include Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia. These states typically use chemical de-icers, such as road salts, to treat roadways in winter weather.
According to Toyota's press release, the company will do the following for Tundra owners subject to the recall: 

Beginning in Dec. 2009 through early 2010, owners of the involved vehicles will receive a Safety Recall notification via first class mail asking them to take their vehicles to a Toyota dealer for an initial inspection of the rear cross member. During this inspection, the rear cross-member including the surrounding components such as the brake line at the proportioning valve (which is mounted on the cross-member assembly) will also be inspected. Based upon the inspection, Toyota will do one of the following at no charge: 

    * If there is no significant corrosion of the rear cross-member assembly or the rear brake line at the proportioning valve, owners will be notified of that fact and requested to subsequently bring their vehicle back to the dealership so that a corrosion-resistant compound can be applied to the rear cross-member. Toyota will notify the owner when the corrosion-resistant compound is available. 

or 

    * If significant corrosion is detected such that the rear cross-member can no longer safely support the spare tire and replacement components are available, the cross- member assembly will be replaced. In the event replacement components are not available, a temporary solution, such as the removal of the spare tire and securing it to the truck bed, will be performed until parts are available. 

In those relatively rare cases where the rear cross-member is significantly corroded and can no longer safely support the spare tire, but the rear cross-member cannot be replaced due to excessive frame corrosion at the mounting location (e.g., if the side rails are too damaged), Toyota will develop an appropriate remedy for those vehicles on a case-by-case basis. 

This inspection will take approximately 20 minutes, depending on dealer scheduling. 

Until your vehicle is inspected, you may minimize the risk of the spare tire separating from the rear cross-member by removing it. If you choose to do so, please be sure not to be under the rear cross-member or spare tire carrier during the lowering process. In addition, if placing the spare tire in the truck bed or other area of the vehicle, it should be secured when driving.
Customers with questions are asked to call the Toyota Customer Experience Center at 1 (800) 331-4331.

 Toyota has expanded its initial floormat recall to 4 million vehicles. It will now reconfigure the accelerator pedal to prevent it from getting caught in the floormat, causing unintended acceleration, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 

 The automaker also plans to install a brake-override system on some models; if the brake and accelerator are depressed at the same time, the brake will take precedence.
 The recall initially covered the 2007-10 model year Camry, 2005-10 Avalon, 2004-09 Prius cars as well as 2005-10 Tacoma and 2007-10 Tundra trucks. It is also recalling 2007-10 Lexus ES 350, 2006-10 IS 250, and 2006-10 IS 350 models. The increase to 4 million recalled vehicles is to account for those sold since October when the recall was first announced.
 Toyota will still replace the floormats, but dealers will also shave three-quarters of an inch from accelerator pedals. By April, Toyota will have replacement pedals of that length. 
 The automaker will install the break override system on the Camry, Avalon and Lexus ES 350, IS 350 and IS 250 models, calling it ¨¹an extra measure of confidence.¨¹
 Toyota said it will begin fixing the recalled vehicles in early 2010, starting by notifying Camry, Avalon, and ES 350 owners. The Japanese press is speculating that this recall will cost Toyota around $5 billion. There¨¹s no official word on the cost from Toyota at this point.

148,https://www.cars.com/articles/2009/09/explaining-the-toyota-floormat-recall/,Explaining the Toyota Floormat Recall," Toyota is in the process of 

recalling nearly 4 million Toyota and Lexus vehicles
 for an issue with their floormats. A number of complaints have shown that the floormats can creep forward and get stuck under the accelerator, which can lead to unintended and potentially dangerous acceleration. (Yes, we know the recall is not official yet, but for clarity we will call it a recall). 

We had a 2010 Toyota Prius in our test fleet this week and noted its floormat set-up is similar to Toyotas included in the recall. The 2010 Prius is not included in the current recall, but the 2005-2009 Prius is. Toyota spokesman John Hanson said that the 2010 model uses the same type of floormats as the older Prius, as do many other current Toyota models not included in the recall. 

The 2010 Prius, which has only been on sale for a relatively short time, is not included in the recall at this time because there have been no specific complaints filed with either Toyota or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration about the floormats, Hanson said. However, when the recall is finalized, which could be as early as next week, the 2010 Prius may be included, he said. Other models havenüt been included based solely on the lack of complaints. A number of factors including pedal placement and keyless ignition in addition to the floormats may have contributed to the complaints against the recalled cars.
So, what is it about these floormats thatüs causing the problem?
Basically, any automakerüs floormats can slide forward if theyüre not attached to a hook that keeps them in place. However, the Lexus and Toyota models in question include a hook that can be detached from the carpet, meaning there are two ways for the floormat to become dislodged. According to Hanson, the design stems from the fact that floormats are an option across the Toyota lineup, and someone buying a car without them wouldnüt want a fixed stem protruding from the carpet. 

The timing of our Prius loan was pure coincidence. Before the recall was announced yesterday, we noticed the floormat had crept forward and its hooks were dislodged from the carpet. Our test cars are delivered from specialized fleets working with the automautomakers and are detailed before delivery. That often involves cleaning and removing the mats. Perhaps ours wasn¨¹t put back properly or one of our editors with big feet kicked it out of place. Hanson mentioned that car washes are a prime opportunity for an owner to check the floormat¨¹s installation. 

Being detail-oriented car people, we popped the floor hooks back in and went on our way. 

Toyota says that they are working on a permanent solution for the recalled models, and it will be developed within the government-mandated timeframe, which will be set after the recall is made official. How long that is we¨¹re not sure. The recall itself is expected to be filed next week. In the meantime, all Toyota and Lexus drivers are being told to remove their floormats from the driver¨¹s side to avoid any issues. 

We would advise all car owners to be aware of their floormat placement, especially when using bulkier all-weather mats. We¨¹d also suggest any owner of a modern Toyota not involved in the recall to be especially vigilant or remove their mats, too.

. The vehicles include the 2009 Nissan Cube and Murano, the 2008 Nissan Rogue, the 2008-2010 Infiniti M35, and 2008-2010 Infiniti M45. 

 The recall is focused on certain vehicles from the 2008-2010 model years originally sold or currently registered in Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington D.C., West Virginia and Wisconsin.
 These vehicles have a nut securing the sensor-transmitter of the tire pressure monitoring system that may corrode and possibly crack when exposed to road salt. The nut may fall out of the sensor-transmitter, which will cause the monitoring light to illuminate.
 If the driver ignores the light and continues to drive the car in this condition, the tire could lose air pressure, resulting in a flat that could potentially cause an accident.
 Nissan dealers will replace the TPMS nut with a ¨¹new, more robust nut¨¹ free of charge. Owners may contact Nissan at 800-647-7261, Infiniti at 800-662-6200 or the NHTSA vehicle safety hotline at 888-327-4236.

154,https://www.cars.com/articles/2009/01/governments-recall-site-sparks-debate/,Government's Recall Site Sparks Debate," Not quite, say consumer advocate groups like the Center for Auto Safety and the Consumer Federation of America. They complain that the program is not only a üsham,ü but also counter-productive.
 NHTSA issues roughly 600 recalls each year, and consumers ü who are usually informed by letters from the manufacturers ü take little notice. One in four owners ignores the notifications, according to the agency, even when the issue could be dangerous.
 Electronic notifications from NHTSA were supposed to help cut that figure, but the problem is that recall notices wouldnüt go out to specific vehicles based on VIN number or even model, but rather just by the make and the year of the car. That means if a 2008 Toyota Tundra were recalled, you would be notified even if you just own a Camry.
 Consumer groups argue that this makes car owners more likely to ignore warnings ü imagine if you received six emails a month about NHTSA recalls along with all the other typical junk that turns up in your inbox. NHTSA says using the VIN number is out of the question because of privacy issues, but that it will review the current notification model to determine if changes are necessary.

The models affected include 2006 3 Series, 2004-06 5 Series and 2004-06 X3 SUVs. 
The problem isn¨¹t in the airbag itself but in the sensors that detect whether there¨¹s a person in the front passenger seat.

However, this defect can cause the sensor to think no one is in the seat when they really are, which could lead to injury. 
BMW says no one has been injured due to the problem, and that the warning light that signals when the airbag is disengaged will flash on and off if the sensor isn¨¹t working properly. 
Concerned owners should check with their dealer to determine if their car is included in the recall and bring it in for service.

The first has to do with the windshield wipers. Approximately 129,600 ¨¹04 and ¨¹05 TLs could have wipers with a faulty circuit breaker that at some point could leave the wipers inoperable. Fixing the problem involves a simple trip to the dealer to check and replace the windshield wiper motor, if necessary. 
 If you only have time to take care of one problem on your Acura TL, however, we kind of recommend this second one. In some cases, engine heat has caused a power-steering hose to crack, which could potentially leak steering fluid onto the catalytic converter. This could lead to a great deal of smoke or, in a worst-case scenario, fire. Honda wants to replace all the hoses.
 No one has yet reported an accident or injury due to either problem, but Acura will of course fix both free of charge. Clearly this is a bargain: A free windshield wiper motor and your car not catching on fire.

 The biggest recalls this year came from Ford, which topped 5.5 million vehicles recalled. Ford¨¹s difficulties largely stemmed from an August recall of 3.6 million vehicles with faulty cruise control switches, an ongoing problem that has led to 10 million vehicle recalls over the past decade.
 Other big totals included DaimlerChrysler, with 1.4 million vehicles recalled (down from 2.4 million in 2006) and Volkswagen, which saw its worst year of the decade with 1.4 million vehicles recalled.

There seems to be a small problem with Fordüs new diesel powered F-Series Super Duty trucks: The tailpipes might just shoot flames. The unintentional fires occur when leaking fuel or oil gets trapped in the new diesel particulate filters near the tailpipe. These filters have been added so that new diesel vehicles can meet strict emissions rules. Ford says there have been three reports of fires, including one that set a small grass fire after the driver pulled over to the side of the road, but there have been no accidents or injuries reported. Roughly 37,000 trucks are being recalled; however, only 8,400 of those have been sold to customers. Those owners will be notified and will be able to get the problem fixed at their dealer. Ford says the problem can actually be resolved by reprogramming the trucküs software in as little as 10 minutes. The üfix,ü though, means that when the computer senses the filter overheating it will tell the truck to power down and drivers will have to pull over until it cools. That sounds mighty inconvenient to us.  Ford Superuper Duty trucks featuring the gasoline powered 6.0 and 7.3-liter engines are not affected by the recall.

Only models with ¨¹ don¨¹t laugh ¨¹ Nissan¨¹s ¨¹intelligent¨¹ keys are affected. These vehicles sometimes won¨¹t start properly, or will start just by moving the steering wheel before the ignition is turned on. That probably surprised a Murano owner or two on their way to work. No injuries have been reported and there¨¹s no word on how Nissan will fix the problem. Owners should check with their local dealer to schedule service.

There have been more than 20 cases of H2s experiencing the extreme problem, including the Bee¨¹s own automotive editor Mark Glover. His 2002 test vehicle is shown here after losing its front left wheel in the newspaper¨¹s parking lot. 
Most of the cases occurred after the vehicle struck another object, but others ¨¹ including Glover ¨¹ say they didn¨¹t hit anything. GM says there¨¹s nothing wrong with the part that caused the problem, even though they replaced it in 2003; complaints documented in the Bee¨¹s report state model years ranging through 2004. NHTSA is continuing an investigation that could eventually lead to a recall. GM says there is nothing wrong with the vehicle.

That includes virtually every Liberty ever produced. The problem arises from a ball joint that could wear down faster than it should, ultimately failing completely and forcing the front end to drop onto the front tires. This would obviously cause a loss of steering control and has accounted for three injuries and 111 other customer complaints to Chrysler. This is the second major recall for the Jeep Liberty¨¹s suspension. 
A recall notice will be sent out in September, but if you own a Liberty you should contact your dealership to schedule an appointment as soon as possible. There will be no charge for service and parts due to the recall.

We¨¹re not sure what ¨¹upgrade¨¹ means, but it doesn¨¹t sound good. More than 200,000 Tundras from 2003 and 2004 are being investigated for suspension issues along with 2004 and 2005 Siennas, which have rear liftgates that can inadvertently close on owners. 
This latest flub ¨¹ in a series of quality flubs ¨¹ is making the world¨¹s No. 2, and in July America¨¹s No. 2, automaker look pretty bad. In Japan the company had to apologize to the goverment and promise more stringent quality control for the shame an investigation there brought to the company.
